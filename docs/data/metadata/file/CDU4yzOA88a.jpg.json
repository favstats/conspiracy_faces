Dad catching baby after a long and powerful labor and birth! #BTS the Midwife actually just stepped right out of frame for a millisecond after helping mom push and make sure head was safely out before leaving it all for Dad to finish the \u201ccatch and lift.\u201d\nYou can see a little darker shadow on the blinds where I edited the small bit of her hand that was still in the shot.  These types of moments are pretty rare and I\u2019m so honored to have gotten to witness and capture this moment for this dad, mom and their baby girl! This one has won a few birth photography awards too! And has been featured all over the world! #signatureshots #hannahillphotography",
