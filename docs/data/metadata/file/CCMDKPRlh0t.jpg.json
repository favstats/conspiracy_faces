    "description": "The best way to guard yourself against falsehood and false teachers is to know the truth. To spot a counterfeit, study the real thing. Any believer who \u201ccorrectly handles the word of truth\u201d (2 Timothy 2:15) and who makes a careful study of the Bible can identify false doctrine. Review the books of the Bible that were written specifically to combat false teaching within the church: Galatians, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, and Jude. It is often difficult to spot a false teacher/false prophet. Satan masquerades as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14), and his ministers masquerade as servants of righteousness (2 Corinthians 11:15). Only by being thoroughly familiar with the truth will we be able to recognize a counterfeit.\n\n#pickupyourcrossandfollowJesus \n#continuetogrowinChrist \n#turnyourlifetoJesusfully \n#usediscernment \n#dontbelukewarm \n#dontbefooled \n#hollyweirdisevil \n#comeoutfromamongthem \n#comeoutofmysterybabylon \n#havenothingtodowithunfruitfulworks \n#havenofellowshipwithdarkness \n#touchnottheuncleanthing \n#bechildrenofthelight \n#repentorperish \n#believeinthegospel \n#GodgivestheHolySpirittothosewhoobeyhim\n#LettheHolySpiritguideyou",
