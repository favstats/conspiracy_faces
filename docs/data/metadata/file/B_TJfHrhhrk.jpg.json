    "description": "As predicted, #climatechange alarmists are coming out of the woodwork to link #COVID19 hysteria to #SustainableDevelopment, aka #Technocracy. Greta promotes the use of \u2018science\u2019 in fighting threats to humanity.\n\nCountries have a chance to choose a new path as societies begin to return to normal after lockdowns imposed to prevent the spread of the #coronavirus, activist Greta Thunberg told an #EarthDay event on Wednesday.\n\nThunberg, who shot to fame as a 15-year-old when she started skipping school on Fridays to protest over carbon emissions outside #Sweden\u2019s parliament building, said the outbreak showed the need for long-term thinking. \u201cWhether we like it not the world has changed, it looks completely different from how it did a few months ago and it will probably not look the same again and we are going to have to choose a new way forward,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one single virus can destroy economies in a matter of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long term and we are not taking these risks into account.\u201d She was taking part in a streamed event to mark Earth Day, launched 50 years ago to highlight environmental challenges.\n\nLast year was the hottest on record in #Europe, according to a study released on Wednesday by the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThunberg\u2019s school strikes calling for climate action sparked a global movement and transformed the now 17-year-old into the equivalent of an environmental rock star.\n\nDrawing on her statement to the #WorldEconomicForum last year, in which she said: \u201cI want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is,\u201d her #FridaysforFuture movement released a video to mark Earth Day showing a family carrying out their normal routine, despite flames licking round their home.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with her approach. U.S #PresidentDonaldTrump in December urged her to \u201cwork on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie\u201d. And while some still question the role of human activity in the rise in temperatures, opinions are also divided on the best approach to handling coronavirus. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #GreenNewDeal #GreenAgenda",
