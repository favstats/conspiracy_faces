The most unexpected plus sign I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2800\n\u2800\nI thought I wasn\u2019t ready for you, but you had other plans. You were ready for your debut into this world.\u2800\n\u2800\nI struggled through out the whole pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t make peace with it all. I could no longer achieve goals. I felt like my life got put on hold. The rhythm I had worked hard to create seemed to lose its beat.\u2800\n\u2800\nWhen you were born I thought it would get easier. That I would suddenly find my purpose again, be creative again, achieve things again. But that wasn\u2019t the case.\u2800\n\u2800\nBut through it all I found something else. I gained a voice, I opened my eyes to other matters, and I remembered that right now in this moment, my purpose is you. You, your brother, and your sister.\u2800\n\u2800\nYes I will still accomplish things, set big goals and crush them, but there\u2019s no longer a timer set.There\u2019s no pressure to rush through life. You helped me to realize that small moves towards something big is how things get done.\u2800\n\u2800\nWhen my eyes are set on you I remember what I\u2019m truly here to do. \u2764\ufe0f\u2800\n\u2800",
