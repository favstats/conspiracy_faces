    "description": "@unclesamsmisguidedchildren This is Demetrius Griffin Jr 15 yo. He was burned alive in a 55 gallon drum in 2016 because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to join a gang in Chicago. His killers have still not been caught. Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t America march for him? Why does America care about career criminals instead of the young black kids  dying in Chicago every weekend? Imagine if we put this much effort into fighting gang violence. Demand the corrupt democratic officials in Chicago make a change. Brutal murders like this happen all the time in Chicago, but the mainstream media doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover it. It just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit the agenda.\n\nThe family of Demetrius appeared on a Fox News special to discuss Gang violence in Chicago. They talked about how a gang tried to recruit Demetrius a few days before his death and how they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gather any information from the public because of a no snitch policy. The neighborhoods are afraid of the gangs. This is why less than 22% of black murders are solved in Chicago. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m saying all of this because people keep commenting that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prove a gang did it if they never caught the killers. Either way my point still stands. BLM does not care about black lives. If they did they would be discussing Chicago and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brutal murders of  black kids on a monthly basis. Not to mention how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re never solved.\n\nfacts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about your feelings and neither do I. In 2019 235 Black people were killed by the police and less than 10 were unarmed. During one weekend in Chicago that same year 52 shootings occurred and 10 deaths. Police said most of the shootings that weekend were gang related. Im saying this because I want Black Americans  to wake up and realize there being used by the Democratic Party.",
