Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s office gave the \u201cgreen light\u201d for taxpayer funds to be given to Democrat groups as part of the state\u2019s #coronavirus \u201c#contacttracing\u201d program. \u201cWhitmer\u2019s office gave the \u2018green light\u2019 for a #COVID19 contact tracing \u2018arrangement\u2019 she denied knowledge of and canceled amid outcry over a contractor with Democratic ties,\u201d Bridge Magazine, a local Michigan publication, reported. \u201cEmails obtained through a public records request appear to show Michigan officials tried to avoid controversy by shifting work to apolitical subsidiaries of firms with known partisan leanings.\u201d DailyWire report: A senior adviser in the Michigan Department of the Health and Human Services, Andrea Taverna, said in an email to Michigan government officials: \u201cWe got the green light from EOG [the executive office of the governor] to move forward with a slightly different organizational arrangement of the contact tracing volunteer work. This would still be working with Mike Kolehouse, so work there isn\u2019t lost \u2013 it\u2019s just organized somewhat differently \u2013 see below.\u201d In late April, The Washington Free Beacon reported that Whitmer had given control of the state\u2019s contact tracing program to \u201cone of the left\u2019s biggest technology firms\u201d and that the move was seen as potential way of her \u201cusing the coronavirus to strengthen the Democratic Party\u2019s data operation.\u201d The Washington Post reported that the group that hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were going to go \u201cwould be managed in coordination with EveryAction, a firm that is closely linked to NGP VAN, a technology provider that boasts that it powers \u2018nearly every major Democratic campaign in #America.\u2019\u201d Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel highlighted an alleged Facebook post from a Democrat operative who also revived a contract from Whitmer\u2019s administration that stated: \u201cI hope [Trump] gets Coronavirus ASAP. Can someone do the country a favor and cough on that man.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #VaccineAgenda #PopulationControl #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #ContactTracers #TraceForce",
