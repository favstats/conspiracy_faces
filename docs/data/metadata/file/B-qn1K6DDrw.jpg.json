I posted this last friday on my facebook page. Since then they have mentioned the underground tunnels and human trafficking! The truth is revealing itself slowly, but surely\ud83d\udc4d\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is what I wrote...\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nMy page is about coming into WHOLENESS through self-LOVE.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nHowever, love DOESN\u2019T end with us. As we love and respect ourselves, we won\u2019t be able to look away when someone else suffers, especially innocent children\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc9c\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThis isn\u2019t anything political either. This is about humanity. Our lives as ONE.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI share my beliefs with you guys. Just take what resonates with you\u263a\ufe0f\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThis has been heavy on my heart the past few weeks...\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThousands of children are being rescued from slavery, abuse and torture. Some will have never seen sunlight\ud83d\ude1e\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThe big white ships are sent out to aid in their rescue... called MERCY and COMFORT\ud83d\ude4f\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI don\u2019t know how they can heal from what they experienced, but all my LOVE goes out to them.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nMillions have been victim to human trafficking in underground tunnels (there are maps you can find about this).\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nIt\u2019s a worldwide problem. And if it takes this lockdown to do all this work, I honor staying at home.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThe U.S. military, Trump and others involved are helping with this rescue.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nAs much DARKNESS there is in this world, there is just as much LIGHT\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
