    "description": "I was on an Oprah show in 2006 and asked what I thought of Gardisil. I said \"\"My answer will not be popular. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone\"\". That stuff was fast tracked with no good data. Now here we are in 2020 and women all over the world have suffered and died needlessly. Japan has banned it. And this shot has never been proven to prevent cervical cancer. Please do your own research before letting one of your loved ones get this shot!!! #healthfreedom #knowtherisks #informedconsent #rejectbigpharma #followthemoney #mybodymychoice #womensbodieswomenswisdom",
