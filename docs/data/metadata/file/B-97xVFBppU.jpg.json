    "description": "#Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday reiterated plans to issue an executive order this week that would kickstart the process of reopening the state\u2019s economy, including guidance for businesses on how to re-open.\n\nHis remarks came after he told reporters Friday he planned to issue an executive order that will \u201cfocus on protecting lives while restoring livelihoods.\u201d It will be \u201cabout reopening Texas businesses \u2026 in a way that will be safe for that economic revitalization,\u201d he said.\n\nLike most states in #America, recent orders in Texas mandate residents mostly stay at home unless they\u2019re taking so-called essential trips, in a bid to slow the spread of the CCP (#ChineseCommunistParty) virus, commonly known as the #novelcoronavirus.\n\nThe governor on Monday said, \u201cimpact economically\u201d caused by the #CCPvirus cannot be ignored. \u201cLater this week, I will outline both safe and healthy strategies where we can begin the process of going about reopening businesses in Texas and revitalizing the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nHe highlighted that re-opening the state\u2019s economy does not mean Texas will be given the all-clear. \u201cI have some good news, I will call it glimmers of hope with a whole bunch of red flags attached to those glimmers of hope,\u201d Abbott said, referring to the recent drop in confirmed #COVID19 cases in the state.\n\nConfirmed CCP virus cases in Texas rose to 13,906 on Monday, with 287 deaths. But the growth rate has slowed down after #socialdistancing measures were implemented last month, officials said, while the percentage of cases requiring hospital care has remained steady at around 10 percent of those who test positive.\n\nAn estimated 2,269 COVID-19 patients have recovered, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nState officials are in contact with the White House to make sure the new guidelines will follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health officials on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and economic officials like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
