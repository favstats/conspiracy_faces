    "description": "Silence = complacency. I\u2019ll be honest this one is tough. I\u2019ve literally lost friends (and followers probably) for speaking out on things that feel too important not to share.\u2063\n\u2063\nI have a tiny little platform, which means it is my honor to get to share what I want. It is my DUTY to share the truth. Every damn day I can\u2019t stop thinking about ways to protect our future generation. Many of you have been non stop connecting with me in the DMs and joined our group Telegram.\u2063\n\u2063\nAlways always always I will be a truth seeker and I will think OUTSIDE of the box anyone tries to lock my mind in. My gut tells me what is the truth, and I\u2019ve been sharpening this ol intuition skill for years.\u2063\n\u2063\nI know too many people who are afraid to speak out in fear of losing followers and to that I call BS. WE NEED YOU!!!! We need more thinkers speaking up and speaking out and not just sharing the latest freaking smoothie or workout of the day. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you feel uncomfortable with what\u2019s happening DO SOMETHING. Tell everyone you know to send a letter to your local politicians to let them know #idonotconsent !!!\u2063\n\u2063\nLink is in my profile to send an email you can customize and automatically send. It\u2019s so easy, it took me 5 minutes to fully read over, customize, and send. Also bit.ly/action-usa will take you to the same link.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhat are you doing about it? Have you already been speaking out? How\u2019s that going for you? Have any recommended accounts to follow? Tag someone who needs to read this!\n#idonotconsent #wearethenews",
