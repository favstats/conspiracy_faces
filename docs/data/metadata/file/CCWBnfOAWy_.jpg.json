    "description": "Reposted from @darealsaucemoney I wonder if Oprah is ever going to explain these relationships? Instead of building up Black men, she takes aim every chance she gets to discredit them.  What about her ties with these pedophiles and rapist? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge her to explain those relationships, where woman and children are being RAPED, KILLED, and HARVESTED for ANDRENOCROME by her constituents. The violation of CHILDREN and the shedding of their innocent blood is UNFATHOMABLE!  If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re knowingly in business with these sick bastards, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stand by idly or turn a blind eye, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just as guilty. So Oprah might not have a bracelet on her ankle, but she dam sure has these relationships on her resume.  So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge her to explain this. Until then, we ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t letting her, and nobody else off the hook. #rapist #pedohiles #oprah #johnofgod #harveyweinstein #andrenochrome #innocent #children #guilty #convicted - #regrann",
