    "description": "Did you know that cloth masks may lead to an increased risk of infection for healthcare workers? \u201cThis study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.\u201d\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/\n\nWant to stay informed?
