    "description": "One concept that this community has opened my eyes to is energy. We all know the old physics lessons from secondary school about energy. But what no one ever taught us is that energy permeates everything, including us, the individual. Be good to yourself. Treat yourself well. Talk to yourself positively, always. The cabal manipulates our energy far more than we understand or willing to accept at this point. Take it back by starting within you. #mymaria777",
