    "description": "Who should you listen to about vaccines?\n\nShould you listen the vaccine manufacturers when it comes to vaccine safety? They make billions of dollars a year off these products. Vaccines are also the ONLY product in America that are completely immune from liability if they harm you.\n\nShould you listen to the news or media? They receive billions a year for ads from big pharma. The vast majority of their ad money comes from these companies.\n\nShould you listen to your doctor? They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taught about vaccines in medical school. They also are paid bonus money to administer vaccinations and give out other pharmaceutical recommendations.\n\nOR.... Should you listen to the parents who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being paid a dime. They are simply telling you the stories of what vaccines did to their children in hopes of saving yours. \nThink about next time a parent tries to warn you about vaccines. Remember this when you ask someone if they are a doctor or what their credentials are. Parents know when something has happened to their child. They know a lot more than some repeater in a white lab coat who spent years being indoctrinated. They know more than a news reporter who is just siding with the pharmaceutical companies who pay to keep their shows going. They certainly know more than the vaccine manufacturers who will do anything to sell you their poison.",
