    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nThe #WorldHealthOrganization has declared a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d over the outbreak of the 2019nCoV, or the #Wuhancoronavirus. The international body didn't recommend travel and trade restrictions.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the #coronavirus \u201ca previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak\u201d at a press conference on Thursday, but said the WHO was not recommending restrictions of trade or travel with China, where the virus originated.\n\nTedros pointed out that the declaration was \"\"\"\"not a vote of no confidence in China,\"\"\"\" but made out of concern for other countries, with \"\"\"\"weaker\"\"\"\" healthcare systems.\n\nChina\u2019s response to the outbreak has been \u201cvery impressive,\u201d the WHO chief added. \u201cSo is China\u2019s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries.\"\"\"\" China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\n\nWhile the majority of coronavirus cases have been registered in China, the WHO confirmed there were 98 confirmed cases elsewhere in the world \u2013 including eight cases of direct transmission in #Germany, #Japan, #Vietnam and the US.\n\nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases outside of China have either traveled to Wuhan or been in contact with someone who has, the WHO officials noted. \u201cThe only way we will defeat this outbreak is for all countries to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cWe are all in this together, and we can only stop it together.\u201d Coronavirus is the unofficial name of the pathogen, which the WHO is referring to by its interim name, 2019-nCoV. The condition caused by it is being called \u201c2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
