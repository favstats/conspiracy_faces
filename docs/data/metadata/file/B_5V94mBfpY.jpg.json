    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nOne thing that should be abundantly clear by now is that any thoughts, opinions, or speculation which challenges the official narratives regarding #COVID19 will be promptly silenced by #SiliconValley, under the guise of protecting the public - which apparently can't be trusted to absorb information and form their own opinions.\n\nThe most recent example of censored wrongthink is a new documentary, #Plandemic, which features former chronic fatigue researcher Judy Milkovits, who claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci - head of the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - is spewing 'absolute #propaganda' about COVID-19.\n\nIn the video, Mikovits claimed Fauci perpetrated propaganda that led to the deaths of millions of people in the past. She also raised questions about how COVID-19 deaths are being counted.\n\nHowever, one of her biggest beefs against Fauci dates to the battles for credit over the discovery of HIV in the early 1980s.\n\nIn the video, Mikovits claimed she isolated HIV from the saliva and blood of patients in France but that Fauci was involved in delaying research so a friend could take credit, which allowed the HIV virus to spread. These claims are not proven. They were also disseminated in April by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy alleged on the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Defense website (where he is chairman) -Heavy\n\nGoogle's YouTube is currently playing whack-a-mole with a 25 minute promotional vignette for the documentary which has gone viral - deleting new versions seemingly as fast as they pop up. The original version had over 1.6 million views when it was censored.\n\nRead More: [http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/PQU7N5FYEn0/youtube-deletes-viral-video-claiming-dr-fauci-spewing-absolute-propaganda-about-coronavirus] #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
