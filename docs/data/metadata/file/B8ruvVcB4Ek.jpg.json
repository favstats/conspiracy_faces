The Mail Online reports: A lawsuit filed in the Southern District of #NewYork claimed that Nygard plied his subjects with alcohol and drugs before they were violently assaulted, raped and sodomized.\n\nThe case could prove embarrassing for Prince Andrew \u2013 who once stayed at Nygard\u2019s mansion \u2013 linking him to another high profile billionaire accused of sexual abusing young women.\n\nThe #DukeofYork has already faced intense scrutiny for his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \nIn the latest case, the teenagers have launched a class action lawsuit in #Manhattan federal court, claiming to have been a part of what was essentially a \u2018sex trafficking ring.\u2019 The suit alleges the girls would be entertained at so-called \u2018pamper parties\u2019 where Nygard would have bartenders at his Mayan-themed vacation home spike their drinks with the \u2018date-rape drug\u2019, known as #Rohypnol. \nNygard\u2019s staff were instructed to find young women for the weekly parties, the lawsuit claims. \nAs guests arrived and checked-in, their details would be placed into a database with the photos sent to Nygard to look over. \nNygard would then use this information to select his potential victims for the night,\u2019 the suit states.\n\nThe lawsuit details how one of the victims who was 15-years-old at the time had been taken to Lyford Cay, Nygard\u2019s estate, which was once featured on the TV show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#LolitaExpress #PedoGate #PizzaGate #StopHumanTrafficking #EpsteinDidntKillHimself",
