    "description": "Activists groups lure gullible consumers into thinking they have the answer for making healthier choices. They comb the literature for high-dose animal studies that bear little resemblance to real- world human exposure. They excel in amping up fear using biased conclusions to blow up any and all adverse effects where none actually exist. They use weasel-words like \u201cthis suggests\u201d, \u201clinked to\u201d, \u201cassociated or correlated with\u201d. They skew the available data into a modern horror story. Then they get a journalist to spread their click bait.\nA new study suggests that if you follow NGO activists there\u2019s a 100% chance that you are scientifically illiterate.  See how that works?\nThey have a reason to scare you- they profit off your fear.  What they\u2019re certifying or recommending is no more safe than what\u2019s on the market.  If they quote the EWG, run.\nTheir hazard ratings do not look at the actual level of exposure of beauty products. It totally ignores dose, and therefore cannot assess risk.",
