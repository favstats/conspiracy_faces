    "description": "Excellent Undercover Journalism by @Project_Veritas and @ProjectVeritasAction\n\nA second #BernieSanders field organizer has been caught on undercover camera extolling the virtues of #gulags - only this one can barely contain himself over arming himself for the \"\"\"\"fucking #revolution.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"I'm ready to tear bricks up and start fighting,\"\"\"\" says Martin Weissgerber - who deleted his Twitter account Tuesday morning after #ProjectVeritas released their latest hit. \"\"\"\"I'll straight up get armed ... I'm ready for the fucking revolution, bro.\"\"\"\" Weissgerber also dreams of 'dissolving the  Senate, House of Representatives and Judicial Branch' so that 'somebody like Bernie Sanders and a cabinet of people can make all the decisions for the climate.' \"\"\"\"What will help is when we send all the Republicans to the 're-education' camps,\"\"\"\" he said, adding \"\"\"\"Can you imagine Mitch McConnell [impersonates Mitch looking around a gulag], Lindsey Graham? [mocks with gay wrist]\"\"\"\" The Bernie organizer then tries to sell the undercover journalist on the virtues of gulags, which he says were \"\"\"\"founded as #reeducationcamps\"\"\"\" - citing the 1933 Soviet Belomorkanal project linking the White Sea to the Baltic - which used gulag prisoners to build, and which Weissgerber claims \"\"\"\"people came from #America to work on.\"\"\"\" Veritas notes that 25,000 people died building it.\n\nAccording to journalist Andy Ngo, Weissgerber is an aspiring Soundcloud rapper who hates police officers, Israel, women and of course - #Trumpsupporters. #CivilWar #Destabilization #FEMACamps",
