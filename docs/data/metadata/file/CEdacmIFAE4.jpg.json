But after all, it\u2019s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it\u2019s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it\u2019s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials\n\n#1986TheAct #HealthFreedom #HaveCouragebutBeKind",
