As we previously reported, President Trump has gone from being a staunch #antivaxxer to being a COVID-19 vaccination cheerleader. Now today he told Fox News that he is mobilizing the US military to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine when it\u2019s ready, probably at the end of the year. Vaccinations at the point of a gun? Yep, looks like that\u2019s where we are at the moment.\n\nFor legal reasons I cannot tell you what you should do about receiving a COVID-19 vaccination shot, but I sure can tell you what I will do. Under no circumstances nor at an time will I receive a COVID-19 vaccination shot from any entity be it public, private or Trump. Not even the assembled might of the United States military could compel me to do that. I have told you all many, many times now, yes, Bill Gates is one of the major players but he is not the only player. Don\u2019t have your eyes on any one person, or you\u2019ll miss it. It\u2019s a system, a global system.\n\nTrump says he would mobilize military to distribute coronavirus vaccine when it\u2019s ready\n\nFROM CBS NEWS: \u201cWe\u2019re mobilizing our military and other forces but we\u2019re mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it\u2019s a massive job to give this vaccine. Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we\u2019re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will have a tremendous force because assuming we get it, then you have to distribute it,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd unless you\u2019re mobilized and ready, you\u2019re not going to be able to do it for a long time. So we\u2019re starting now.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#VaccineAgenda #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #CoViD1984 #ContactTracing #PopulationControl #Technocracy",
