    "description": "Our baby girl, just a few days new. \u2728 Now she's a strong, busy, joyful little toddler who is practically flying towards two. Time is wild. \n\u1571\nI'm sure you've heard about a vaccine in the works for you know what. \"\"They\"\" are going to tell you that it\u2019s \"\"safe and effective\"\" and necessary even, for you and for the ones that you love. \n\u1571\nThere is SO MUCH more to it and I cannot urge  you enough to take the time to inform yourself on the history, efficacy, and side effects of vaccines. We are the gatekeepers of our homes. We have been entrusted with our precious little ones. We owe it to them to be informed. \n\u1571\nThe facts, documents and statistics are there to support concern about these medical procedures. There is not a one size fits all answer. This decision must be weighed human being-by-human being. And it must be ours to make. \n\u1571\nI'm not telling what to think or what to do. You alone get to decide. But having all the resources and information matters. Follow your God given intuition. Ask all the questions. \n\u1571\nI get it. It can be totally overwhelming to try to dive into this. Jord and I are currently watching a 9-part docuseries by\u00a0@thetruthaboutvaccinesttav. It is factual, thorough and answers many common questions. We highly reccomend it!! Look at the information and then make an INFORMED decision for your family. \n\u1571\nThe third episode airs tonight.\n.\n.\n.\nFor those informed, please share your favorite books + resources below so we can help each other learn and become equipped. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb",
