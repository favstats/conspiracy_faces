    "description": "I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just one of many health sites, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fortunate to have higher traffic . I also feel that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost a bit of a duty for us all to hold other sites accountable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to call them out by name because that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cool, but hear me out. The picture on the bottom is going viral right now and they are explaining that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a waitress at a restaurant and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how she is dressed. So I took two seconds, which any first grader could do, and I did a reverse search on the picture only to find that it is Photoshop. We have major journalists and medical doctors posting the bottom photo as if it is GOSPEL. But this ends up being to their detriment and for all of our detriment. Obviously I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share it until I looked it up. If you post a fake picture: This only gives ammunition to the detractors and again does not lead to credibility. Yes there is some talk of servers in certain places wearing Face shields for those who wear them, placing them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collar up\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. But sometimes I wonder when I see so many sources then posting a fake photo along with it if they are purposely spreading misinformation. So short term they will have much more traffic or garner some more readers, but long-term, if they do this consistently then people will lose face like the boy who cried Wolf. This might seem like a mild example, but the problem is that thousands of people will share the Bottom picture with friends and family only to be called out and then they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that this is happening in the state of Maine at all. Know your sources. So you can trust sharing with others and it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t backfire. #HealthNutNews #ErinElizabeth #Truth #HealthFreedom #HolisticHealth #MedicalFreedom",
