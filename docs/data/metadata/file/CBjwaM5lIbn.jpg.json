It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never the passionate mother who will do ANYTHING for her children box.\n\nInstead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the\n- crazy anti- vaxxer\n- liar\n- trouble maker\n- selfish white woman\n- crunchy crazy lady\n- conspiracy theorist \nAnd so many more.\n\nFirst they came for our medical freedom.\nThen our religious freedom.\nOur freedom to school our children publicly while also keeping our beliefs.\nOur community freedom.\nOur parental freedom.\nOur gun freedom is on the line as we speak.\n\nSee, this is always how it happens. A slow roll. A move here, a twist of the words there. So slowly that you barely notice it.\n\nThe people with kids didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem bothered or upset when they started stripping parents of their freedoms. Touting that they were just being too loud! Would you please just follow the rules!! Then they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything when they came for  our church. We have no choice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the good of the order. Just listen and be a good little girl.\n\nThey they stayed silent when they came for our schools. Even if they disagreed they stayed silent because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rock the boat.\nSomeone else will do it for me.\nSomeone else will read that for me.\nSomeone else will educate me so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to educate myself.\nThey stayed quiet because getting loud meant getting uncomfortable and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do that now do we.\n\nThey came for our community freedom. And we sat down and believed the lies over and over and over again because we were too scared. Some are still so scared they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even question the narrative.\nOh thank God! We got approved for phase two! All we have to do now is wear our masks everywhere!\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ring a bell, you come get your treat!\n\nThey came for our law enforcement. We stayed silent because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get called names. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be an outcast. We stood/stand by as our friends now fear for their lives. As dreams are crushed. Lifelong work destroyed and we say NOTHING.\n\nThey will come for the guns next and people will get upset. How could this happen? All while ignoring every single step that came before this one.\nCont in comments....",
