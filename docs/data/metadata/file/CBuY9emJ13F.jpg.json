    "description": "No doubt in my mind this guy was the most divisive prez ever.  He was aided by the coinciding rise and takeover of leftist social media.  The first black prez. What an amazing accomplishment. What an opportunity to unify us all. Nope. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about the black community or anyone else. See his hometown Chicago. He is part of a massive leftist agenda to crush America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core values.  He supports ideological bigotry and the destruction of the constitution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not racist to wake up and speak up against violence and looting. Put God first. Wake up. Stand up. #Godwins #freedomwins #wakeup\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n#freedom #liberty #follow #usa #fakenews #danbongino #godfirst #unclesamsmisguidedchildren #lexit #blexit #blackconservative #latinosfortrump #trump2020 #donaldtrump #donaldtrumpjr #merica #usa #america #turningpointusa #me #scamdemic #unitedstates #undergod #makeamericagreatagain",
