How much are you controlling your own internal environment, that you have way more power over?\n.\n.\nBy reclaiming our power over our bodies, we reclaim our sovereignty and one of the best ways to do that is by taking charge of our own health.  I'm currently filming the next video all about health sovereignty and immune support but for now here are my top favourite immune boosting herbs/supplements and hacks (please note, I'm not a Dr. just a very avid health geek and am sharing what's worked for me, like with everything remain sovereign and do your own research to find what would suit your health situation best):\n.\n.\n\u2728Colloidal silver\n\u2728Echinacea \u2728Zinc \u2728Vitamin C\n\u2728Ozone therapy \u2728A good gut cleanse \u2728Probiotic \u2728Grounding \u2728Vitamin D + sunlight\n\u2728Plant based diet rich in fruits n veggies - keep mucus-forming animal products to an absolute minimum or eliminate them completely.\n\nI'll expand more fully in the video so watch this space for the drop. \u270c\ud83c\udffd\n.\n.\n#staysafe #gooutside #grounding #vitamind #plantbasedliving #mucuslessdiet #gutcleanse #ozonetherapy #immunesupport #healthsovereignty #healthfreedom #healthtips #healthhacks #veganhealth",
