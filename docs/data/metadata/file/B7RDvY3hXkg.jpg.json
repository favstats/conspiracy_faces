    "description": "During a recent interview with Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham, U.S. #PresidentDonaldTrump made some telling comments about the true motives behind the foreign policy of the #UnitedStates. When speaking optimistically about the country\u2019s diplomatic relationship with #SaudiArabia, Trump bragged bout how much the oil-rich dictatorship paid the U.S. for military support. \u201cSaudi Arabia is paying us for [our troops]. We have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia. I said, listen, you\u2019re a very rich country. You want more troops? I\u2019m going to send them to you, but you\u2019ve got to pay us. They\u2019re paying us. They\u2019ve already deposited $1 billion in the bank,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn effect, Trump was suggesting that U.S. troops are acting as mercenaries for Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million\u2026 I said, \u2018You gotta help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting you from North Korea. You\u2019ve gotta pay\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nAnti-war conservative Rep. Justin Amash, who recently split from the Republican Party, was quick to point out this gross misuse of military power.\n\nAmash has been a critic of Trump\u2019s foreign policy for the duration of his presidency and was equally critical of Obama. Amash was one of the few Republicans who supported the recent measure to impeach President Trump. On Meet the Press in October, Amash spoke of this specific practice of hiring troops out to countries like Saudi Arabia. \u201cThere are people who support the president, who believe things he says, but it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s not bringing home the troops. He\u2019s just moving them to other parts of the #MiddleEast. He\u2019s moving troops back into #Iraq, he\u2019s moving other troops into Saudi Arabia and using our forces almost as mercenaries, paid mercenaries who are going to come in, as long as Saudi Arabia pays us some money, it\u2019s good to go,\u201d Amash said. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
