There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a catch to what they do. They never do things out of the goodness of their own hearts. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry though because the way they tax people in this country and how they hold on to money that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rightfully theirs is a sin in the Bible. And this country will pay for what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a method to their madness, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much method to yours - Phil Schneider.
