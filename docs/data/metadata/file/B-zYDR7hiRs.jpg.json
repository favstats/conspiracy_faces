I am a COVID-19 warrior on the frontline and I have been infected with COVID-19. I\u2019ve been educating and posting my experience on my main account (@michael_danila). This is NOT a HOAX. For all of those doing the #filmyourhospital trend, there is a reason why we don\u2019t want to reveal the inside of the hospitals. It is an absolute warzone. A image of hell with God\u2019s angels fighting their hardest to stop the devil from claiming more lives. A sight that we wish no one should ever have to see. So here I am, battling COVID-19 with all of my strength and faith while my brothers and sister fight on the frontlines. My hope is to develop these antibodies that everyone keeps talking about and earn my immunity to the virus. Then I\u2019ll return to helping those who have been SEVERELY affected by the virus with little fear. For now, I will stay home like everyone else should be doing. Stay safe everyone and may God be with you all! This too shall pass \ud83d\ude4f",
