    "description": "Day one shit in my classes is what I refer to as \u2018the responsibilities of a philosopher\u2019 - rationalism, fallibility, and most importantly, skepticism. \u2063\n\u2063\nAt my most conservative, I\u2019m a radical skeptic, meaning I immediately dismiss anything that can be doubted, and at my most extreme, I can be an outright epistemic nihilist, which essentially means  I doubt the possibility of any knowledge altogether.\u2063\n\u2063\nUsing these principles, I personally like to navigate through ideas that are considered taboo by many in philosophy - questioning the possibility of the Illuminati is how I became a philosopher.\u2063\n\u2063\nI may get scoffed at by \u2018professional\u2019 philosophers for doing so, but that\u2019s cool, cuz most of them uphold colonial structures that were exposed via such practices anyways.\u2063\nIt was, after all, once considered a conspiracy to think that the government suppressed information and indoctrinated students to homogenous ways of thinking - ie \u2018how to become a \u2018\u2019proper\u2019\u2019 American\u2019 - and now there are entire courses taught about how to help students - and ourselves - recover from such brainwashing.\u2063\n\u2063\nReality is crazy AF, and excluding ideas you don\u2019t agree with simply because they challenge your predetermined conception of it is a dangerous slope - it is the mark of an intelligent mind to entertain ideas that you don\u2019t agree with \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80.",
