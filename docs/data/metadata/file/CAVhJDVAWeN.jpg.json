    "description": "An alarming new federal bill has surfaced in the US House of Representatives with potentially devastating implications to your #privacyrights and ability to choose how you care for yourself and your #children.\n\u2800\nH.R. 6666 is a federal bill that allocates $100 billion annually to deploy a massive force of #surveillance workers to test, contact trace and enforce the #quarantine of men, women and children in the United States who are thought to be infected \u2014 or potentially infected \u2014 with #COVID-19.\n\u2800\nAccording to the bill, those hired will conduct diagnostic #testing and \u201crelated activities such as #contacttracing through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals\u2019 residences, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\u2800\nThe bill uses broad, open-ended language and fails to specify what \u201crelated activities\u201d or \u201cfor other purposes\u201d are; such ambiguity creates the opportunity for an #abuseofpower, particularly during times of crises.\n\u2800\nThe activities stemming from this #legislation infringe on individuals\u2019 ability to opt out of unwanted surveillance and potentially mandated medical interventions such as testing, treatment and vaccination. Deploying federal workers to individuals\u2019 homes encroaches on their privacy and raises numerous questions.\n\u2800\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Let\u2019s show our #lawmakers how many #people oppose the use of #taxpayer funds (a proposed $100 billion annual budget) for total #citizen surveillance measures that violate #health #freedom #rights.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\u2800\n\ud83d\udc46 Follow the LINK in @standforhealthfreedom\u2019s BIO \u2b06\ufe0f above to \ud83d\udce9email your US senators and representatives NOW and urge them to vote \u274cno on H.R. 6666.\n\u2800\nIt is dangerous legislation that could irrevocably suspend our #civilliberties in the name of containing a #virus that recent research suggests has an estimated 99.9% survival rate\u203c\ufe0f\n\u2800\n#CatholicConnect #standforhealthfreedom #rise #riseup #advocate #advocates #healthfreedom #humanrights #wedonotconsent #informed #consent #medical",
