    "description": "An internal report presented to #Chinese #PresidentXiJinping and other top leaders concludes that global anti-China sentiment is at a level not seen since the 1989 #TiananmenSquare crackdown, and recommends preparing for the worst-case scenario of armed conflict with the #UnitedStates, according to Reuters, citing people familiar with the content of the document.\n\nThe report, created by the China Institutes of Contemporary Internal Relations (CICIR) - which is affiliated with the Ministry of State Security - suggests that the wave of anti-China sentiment is led by the United States, which sees China's rise as a global superpower as a threat to Western democracies.\n\nOne of those with knowledge of the report said it was regarded by some in the Chinese intelligence community as China\u2019s version of the \u201cNovikov Telegram\u201d, a 1946 dispatch by the Soviet ambassador to Washington, Nikolai Novikov, that stressed the dangers of U.S. economic and military ambition in the wake of World War Two.\n\nNovikov\u2019s missive was a response to U.S. diplomat George Kennan\u2019s \u201cLong Telegram\u201d from #Moscow that said the #SovietUnion did not see the possibility for peaceful coexistence with the West, and that containment was the best long-term strategy. -Reuters\n\nReuters, which hasn't seen the paper, couldn't determine to what extent the report's grim outlook reflects positions held by China's state leaders, nor how much it might influence policy. That said, it suggests Beijing is taking the threat of global backlash over the #coronavirus pandemic - which Western intelligence agencies suspect originated at a Wuhan biolab which was experimenting with bat coronavirus, and had previous concerns raised over the pandemic potential of such research. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
