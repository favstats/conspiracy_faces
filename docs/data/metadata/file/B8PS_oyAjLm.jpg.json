I was amazed! I had tried so hard to get her to sleep on her back because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what everyone said she should be doing, I pushed that and the paci way too hard. After listening and finding my little niche of motherhood that makes much more sense to me and fits my beliefs\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I learned so much. I realized that this position so unnatural for babies. This is their most vulnerable position, yet we force them into it and no wonder they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well.\n.\nI know clinical research has its place, and pediatricians know a lot. But sometimes we get so wrapped up in numbers that we forget all common sense and throw natures ways out the window. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always strongly believed in intuition, and I lost that the first few months of motherhood and let fear take over. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m slowly learning how to silence that fear so I can hear that small voice inside a little louder and clearer. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #penelopecolette #documentingmotherhood #honestmom #thisismotherhood #honestmomconfessions #holdthemoments #ig_motherhood #justmomlife #motherhoodrising #motherhoodintheraw #mothersintuition #naturalmotherhood #trustyourself #trustyourintuition #believemothers",
