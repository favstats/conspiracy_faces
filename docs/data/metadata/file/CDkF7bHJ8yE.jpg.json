Which means we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to explain or share all the details of our choices to anyone. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to ask our social worker and/or court judge for permission to leave. We could just, go.\nSo we are going.\nRight now, we are headed to Indianapolis.\nLiving in the Bay was a wildly beautiful & growing experience. We are trusting that this next adventure will be no different.\nCheers to moving across the country for the THIRD time. FIRST TIME WITH KIDS\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b3\n...should I share all the craziness of our 6 day road trip in my stories?((why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there a girl pulling her hair out emoji?!?))\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#fostertoadopt #adoptivemama #fosterfamily #fosterlove #adopttogether #indianapolis #leavethebayarea #movingoutofcalifornia #movingoutofstate #crosscountryroadtrip #leavingcalifornia #leavingcali #healthfreedom",
