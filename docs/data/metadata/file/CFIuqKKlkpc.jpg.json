I often get questions about what it is exactly that I do, so let me introduce myself. \n.\n.\nMy name is Morgan \u00e2\u0153\u00b4 The Gypsy Warrior. I am a Spiritual Mentor \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Soul Coach \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Intuitive Energy Healer \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Akashic Record Practitioner \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Plant Medicine Whisperer \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n.\n.\nWhat I do: I help women reclaim their inner magic. I walk alongside them through healing deep trauma, facing the shadows, and doing the \"\"hard\"\" work. I create a sacred and safe container for them to come just as they are, a space where they are fully loved and supported in their healing journey. We work through past trauma, inner child healing, past life regression, clearing family patterns, transmuting darkness into light, finding deep love for self, and getting clear on manifesting that desired life. \n.\n.\nHow I do it: First, I have walked through these processes in my own journey, I am always learning and growing so that I can be the most authentic version of me, supporting my clients for the highest and greatest good. I work 1:1 in a 3 month coaching container, along with sacred plant medicines, and my intuitive connection to the Divine. I  guide these woman from that threshold of wanting to change to breaking through and rediscovering their own light. This is done in my M.A.G.I.C process. \n.\n.\nWho I help: The woman who is ready to heal. The woman who is tired of the same lessons and cycles showing up and nothing ever changing. The woman who knows it is about damn time she chooses HER. The woman is committed to showing up and doing the work, not for me, but for HER. The woman who is ready to RECLAIM HER MAGIC! \n.\n.\nWhether you are here as a fellow lightworker spreading your magic, a dream client ready to find self-love, or just a supporter of raising the vibe and spreading love; I am so happy you are here \u00e2\u2122\u00a5 #spiritualmentor #soulcoach #spiritualbossbabe #pastliferegression #traumahealing #innerchildhealing #innerchildwork #darktolight #lightworker\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00ab #lightworker #starseed #raiseyourvibe #reclaimyourmagic #reclaimyourpower #findyourlight #shadowwork #wombhealing #sacredfeminineenergy #sacredfeminine #manifestyourdreams #manifestation #intentions #selflovejourney",
