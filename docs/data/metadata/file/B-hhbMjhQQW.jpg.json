    "description": "The #UnitedNations is demanding sovereign nations pay the equivalent of at least 10% of the annual income of the entire planet to a new \u201cfund\u201d announced by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres that will hold approximately $8.7 trillion USD, an unprecedented amount of money that would be 2,900 times greater than the UN\u2019s annual budget.\nUN Secretary-General Guterres announced the creation of the fund for addressing the global #coronavirus pandemic, described as a massive \u201chuman-centered, innovative and coordinated stimulus package,\u201d which would effectively create a new world superpower, with the global agency, presumably the UN itself, in charge of propping up the economies of sovereign nations during the crisis.\nAlthough Guterres doesn\u2019t state it explicitly, he seems to be connecting the new fund, which he calls a \u201cdedicated #COVID19 Response and Recovery Fund,\u201d with the massive stimulus package plan, announcing both measures in the same press release.\nLifeSiteNews reports: Guterres also wants 100 billion USD for the #WorldHealthOrganization, whose president has been blamed for helping to cause the coronavirus pandemic by repeating in January the #Chinese government\u2019s false claim that COVID-19 is not transmissible to humans.\nHe also wants the same organization to build an \u201cinterconnected Global Health Emergency System for data, workforce, and supplies.\u201d Guterres says that the money would be channeled \u201cnot only to the business sector and lead firms, but to the workers and SMEs worldwide that underpin the global economy.\u201d \u201cIt is not enough to protect major businesses: we need to protect their suppliers, and the global consumer demand \u2013 the household income \u2013 that will usher the global economy back to life,\u201d writes Guterres in his report, called \u201cShared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#SocioEconomicReformation #Technocracy #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
