    "description": "When I shot these pics, they were for an upcoming single, a post breakup song. But now I look at this photo and I\u2019m connecting it to the anger and rage I feel around George Floyd murder and other injustices that continue to occur without care or consequence. I don\u2019t have the answers. It\u2019s seems we can\u2019t win whether silent or violent. I\u2019m a black LGBT man, a living one, an artist and I will channel my anger and rage into my creativity. It may disturb some but now is not the time to be comfortable. \nSincerely,\nThe Captain \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2708\ufe0f",
