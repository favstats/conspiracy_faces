Invented May of 2020 the patent owner plans to scale up and distribute to China, America and all over the world!\n.\nDo you know how disgusting it would be to breath in your own germs all day and keep that same mask on your face while you eat!? What about all the food that falls out of your mouth into the mask, are you going to wear that thing with ice cream and pizza sauce all over your face?!\n.\nselling these new stupid and pointless masks!\n.\nOR YEHUDA, ISRAEL: Israeli inventors have developed a coronavirus mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat food without taking it off, a device they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.\n.\nA squeeze of a lever, much like a cyclist operates a handbrake, opens a slot in the front of the mask so that food can pass through.\n.\nThe process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up in a flash a flash like Pac-Man in the arcade game. #WAKEUPSHEEPLE",
