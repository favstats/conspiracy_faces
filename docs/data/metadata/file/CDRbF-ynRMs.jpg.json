    "description": "To raise awareness on human trafficking, I recently partnered with other bloggers, influencers and friends to shed light on one of the biggest problems facing us today.\n.\n.\n.\nDid you know? Each year, an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 men, women, and children are trafficked across international borders (some international and non-governmental organizations place the number far higher), and the trade is growing. Human trafficking is not just a social issue but a racial justice issue as well due to the disproportionate number of children of color who are trafficked each year. Racism and oppression are deeply embedded and perpetuated in human trafficking. \n.\n.\n.\nToday, we want to bring you resources that can help us in this fight. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a stand for all the lives being effected by this illegal trade! \n.\n.\n.\nVisit: www.dosomething.com to see how you can get involved! #whereareallthechildren",
