Continually increasing homelessness, unaffordable housing prices, taxes, regulations/restrictions, uncontrollable fires, and now YEARLY PLANNED ELECTRIC BLACKOUTS for God\u2019s sake!!! California is becoming UNLIVABLE and the voters keep allowing Democrats to make it this way.  And California State representatives, such as Nancy Pelosi, are trying to push there failed-state agendas to the rest of America???\n.\nIn 2016, Trump asked black Americans, \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Since then, black unemployment is the LOWEST ITS EVER BEEN.  Trump also reduced black incarceration through the First Step Act criminal reform bill , funding higher education for historically black colleges, and allowed many black Americans to get off of welfare programs, such as food stamps.\n. \nNow what?  A recent Rasmussen poll shows Trump has 42% of the black vote!  So California, PLEASE ask yourselves - What the hell do you have to lose?  STOP ELECTING DEMOCRATS!\n.\n\u25b6\ufe0fPardon My American Podcast \u25b6\ufe0fLinks to shows in bio page\n.\n#wakeup #wakeupsheeple #wakeupcalifornia #newcaliforniarepublic #californiarepublic #californiafires #democratssuck #democratsdestroyamerica #democratshateamerica #trump2020 #trumpsupporters #trumptrain #trumprally #truthexposed #exposethetruth #democratsfortrump #womenfortrump #gaysfortrump #blacksfortrump #blexit #blackconservativemovement #latinosfortrump #thegreatawakening #wwg1wga #walkaway #votered #voterepublican #voteforchange #conservativewomen #youngrepublicans",
