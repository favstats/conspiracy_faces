    "description": "Teenage #climatechange activist Greta Thunberg has sprung into action again, this time launching a fundraising campaign to help the children of the world survive #Covid19.\n\nPartnering with a Danish foundation, her campaigns aims to help finance the U.N. childrens\u2019 agency\u2019s emergency program to fight the #coronaviruspandemic.\n\nThe seventeen year also called on people everywhere \u201cto step up and join me in support of UNICEF\u2019s vital work to save children\u2019s lives, to protect health and continue education.\u201d She also reminded governments to keep fighting climate change during the pandemic. \u201cLike the #climatecrisis, the #coronaviruspandemic is a child rights crisis\u201d Thunberg was quoted as saying in the #UNICEF announcement.\n\nRT reports: The project will see the young activist partner with #Denmark\u2019s #HumanActFoundation to pledge $100,000 each to the #UnitedNations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), which brings humanitarian aid to children around the globe.\n\nThough the Covid-19 outbreak has largely spared the young, Thunberg nonetheless branded the pandemic a \u201cchild-rights crisis\u201d in a statement announcing the new initiative on Wednesday, calling on people everywhere to \u201cstep up and join me in support of UNICEF\u2019s vital work to save children\u2019s lives.\u201d Thunberg earned her bona fides as a climate soldier at the age of 15 after spearheading a school strike in her native Sweden to demand more aggressive action on climate change, but has since skyrocketed to worldwide fame, touring the planet to angrily lecture \u2018adults\u2019 on the dangers of petroleum-addiction. \nSome critics might argue that the virus \u2013 given her vision of \u201cclimate action\u201d at any cost \u2013 is achieving precisely what she has always dreamed of: curtailing production, grinding air travel to a halt, slashing carbon emissions and reducing air pollution. Yet Thunberg has now made it her job to take on the coronavirus pandemic as well, calling on the world to \u201ctackle two crises at once.\u201d #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Agenda2050 #GreenNewDeal #GreenAgenda #Technocracy",
