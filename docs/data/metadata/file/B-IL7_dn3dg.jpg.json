Its Part Of The Big Deception\n.\nSurat An-Nis\u0101'\nAnd [for] their saying, \"\"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah .\"\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. (Quran 4:157)\n.\nRather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.\n.\n\nAnd there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in Jesus before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection he will be against them a witness.\n.\n.\n#Allah #God #Muslim #Christian #AtheismExposed #SatanLies #GodIsTruth #BibleIsTruth #QuranIsTruth #JesusIsComing #ImamMahdi #ThirdTemple #Dajjal #AntiChrist #WakeUpSheeple",
