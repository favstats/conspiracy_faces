    "description": "The corporate government (#USAInc), Fauci, the Chinese communist party, the CDC, the Rockefeller-owned WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative & big pharma do not promote & support truth, freedom & health. \u2022\nThey fear monger, do not educate, dumb down, deceive, & promote immuno-compromised ill health, medical tyranny, corpseoration profits, & depopulation. \u2022 \u201cThe current trajectory of Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s public \u2018health\u2019 policy will result in the short- and long-term destruction of our citizen\u2019s immune health as well as our nation\u2019s economic health \u2013 perhaps a conscious and intended goal. Dr. Fauci\u2019s policy, at best, is based on a 1950s outdated \u2018one-size-fits-all,\u2019 non-personalized approach to medicine and public health; and, at worst is derived from a \u2018fake science\u2019 understanding of the immune system \u2013 one, which Dr. Fauci, over five decades has perpetuated, and exploited to build his career.\u201d \u2022\nDr. Fauci has significant and deep conflicts of interest with Big Pharma that has a singular aim: Force medical mandates e.g. vaccines upon all Americans. Big Pharma is failing, and is in economic peril. Forced and mandated vaccines are the only path for Big Pharma\u2019s future. \u2022\nDuring Dr. Fauci\u2019s tenure, Americans have been led down a path of corporate solutions delivering policies that have led America to the lowest longevity rates, and highest infant mortality rates, in the western world. \u2022\nIn the current situation purposely driven by fearmongering and fake science, Dr. Fauci, his allies \u2013 Big Pharma, Gates Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Chan-Zuckerberg, WHO, CDC \u2013 and, the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), will profit enormously, both politically and economically, at the expense of the American working people. \u2022\nIt is time we focus on the Immune Health of the American people, which Big Pharma has zero interest in advancing. It is time we fire and indict Anthony Fauci to send a much-needed and long-awaited signal to his Big Pharma allies. \u2022\nFull video:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k05b8aGDCNI&feature=youtu.be\nCont\u2019d \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd",
