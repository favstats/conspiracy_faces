    "description": "On May 1, 2020, 45 congress members co-sponsored Bill HR 6666, proposing to spend $100 BILLION dollars in 2020 to hire \"\"\"\"contact tracers\"\"\"\", coronavirus testers, and reporting agents. If passed, this would create an unprecedented new mega-industry for what appears to be a type of \"\"\"\"medical martial law\"\"\"\". Proponents of this bill apparently want to hire a massive number of staff to enforce \"\"\"\"social distancing\"\"\"\", administer tests in our homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d apparently whether we consent or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and apparently even grant themselves the right to take people who \"\"\"\"test positive\"\"\"\" from their homes!\n\nThe full name of this bill HR 6666 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d yes, that's the actual bill number \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is the \"\"\"\"COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act\"\"\"\". As many of you know, what is referred to as \"\"\"\"contact tracing\"\"\"\" is more aptly called total Big Brother surveillance. #NOWEDONOTCONSENT \nhttps://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=8778",
