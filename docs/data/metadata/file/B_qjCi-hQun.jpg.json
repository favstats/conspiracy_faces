    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr said Friday that it is time to curtail some of the restrictive #coronavirus measures imposed by local and state governments. \u201cIt is time to start rolling back some of these restrictions in an orderly and sensible way and the president has provided his Opening the United States Again plan that provides a sensible approach \u2014 framework \u2014 to that,\u201d Mr. Barr said in a question-and-answer session on Twitter.\n\nMr. Barr revived his frequent criticism of rules put in place to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. He has slammed some of the restrictions as \u201c#draconian\u201d and last week directed U.S. attorneys to take legal action if a state or legal measure violates #American\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nThe nation\u2019s top cop said the government \u201cunquestionably\u201d has broad emergency powers during a pandemic, but cautioned that doesn\u2019t mean it can get away with suspending civil liberties. \u201cThe Bill of Rights doesn\u2019t go away during a crisis like this, but what it does do is it requires the government to justify any restrictions as truly necessary and ensure there are not other ways of addressing the government\u2019s interests that are less burdensome on our rights,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nHe said when the pandemic first struck, it was appropriate to impose social distancing and other measures because the virus \u201cwas very contagious and we didn\u2019t want it to overwhelm our health care system.\u201d But now the curve has been flattened and the hospitals are not overwhelmed, it is time to end some of the restrictive measures, he said.\n\nMr. Barr also said the Bureau of Prisons has released 5,000 federal inmates since the pandemic began and 1,000 more releases are in the pipeline.\n\nHe said only nonviolent inmates are being released and the government is ensuring all recently released offenders have a place to stay.",
