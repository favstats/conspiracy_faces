Janny and I have been eating here almost daily the last few weeks. My fav is the Caesar Wrap (those grilled lemons \ud83e\udd24) and my drink of choice is a lavender latte (half sweet) with oat milk. So many organic and locally sourced ingredients with a curated menu that meets the needs of everyone! And hello, this Sunday they have a sweet menu for Father\u2019s Day! #notanAD #justlove #franklintn #locallyowned #smallbusiness",
