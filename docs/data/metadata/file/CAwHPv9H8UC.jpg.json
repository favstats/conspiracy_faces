    "description": "Selling your soul is metaphorically speaking about the process of trading your eternal essence or eternal life for temporary pleasures of this world. We all have 2 voices in our head which is actually the same voice. One is good and wants the best for people. The other is evil and negative.  Some refer to this voice as God and the Devil. So to sell your soul you are basically doing something out of character and unethical for temporary pleasures of this world. When you do good deeds you get eternal pleasure. But when you do bad deeds such as abuse drugs, alcohol, overindulgence in sex, hurt people, ect... you get temporary pleasure. The elites and evil people in power are fueled by temporary pleasures. Lucifer or the devil runs this world and he is all about influencing people to indulge in evil acts that will destroy the sprit. Why do you think when we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have these temporary pleasures we get depressed and or withdrawal. We deal with the internal guilt later. However when you are one with God you are promised eternal life. Remember when the devil took jesus to the top of the hill and promised him all of the riches and glories of this world and Jesus denied it? This is an allegory of what happens when you get massive fame and social status in this world. You must perform acts that keep the masses of people on a low vibration and destroy the sprit of people in order to keep your high rank in this world. The more evil the acts the more temporary pleasures they get. This is when you start to get into rituals, sacrificing children, drinking blood (adrenochrome), sex rituals ect. They get a massive high and feeling of power when they do these acts and they have to continue doing these things in order to keep their power. Selling your soul basically means doing immoral and out of character acts for temporary power and pleasures of this world. On the contrary, if you help others and love others you will have eternal happiness and joy.-\n-\n-\n#sellingyoursoulexplained #sellingyoursoultothedevil #evilelites #hollyweirdisevil #hollywoodisevil #eternallife #godisgood #goodandevil #exposingtruth #exposingevil #evilcantphaseme #spirit #soul #spiritualbeing #spiritualwarfare",
