I remember her being constantly accosted by the paparazzi, her every move scrutinized and judged by the public. Me included. If all this is true, I could not feel more horrible for passing judgement against this poor girl. No one deserves this kind of treatment. Slavery of a different kind. I used to think she was just another media queen with everything at her disposal and not a care in the world. Makes her song \"\"Lucky\"\" all too poignant now. \nPosted @withregram \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 @the.time.is.now1 #Repost @repost.facts\n#sheepnomore #thegreatawakening #thestorm #qanon #wwg1wga #digitalsoldiers #wethepeople #panicindc #patriotsfight #pizzagateisreal #pedogate #adrenochrome #epsteindidntkillhimself #savethechildren #spiritcooking #draintheswamp #redpill #weareq #trump2020 #witchhunt #godwins #wikileaks #painiscoming #symbolismwillbetheirdownfall #thesepeoplearesick #enjoytheshow #nothingcanstopwhatiscoming #wwg1wgaworldwide",
