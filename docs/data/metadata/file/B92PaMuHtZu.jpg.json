    "description": "The Future Of Smart Dust\nSmart dust is a camera/sensor with GPS capabilities. It measures out to be 15x .15mm, nearly the size of a grain of salt. It can be sprayed on us, absored, taken in food and drinks or injected. Sounds like it's something right out of a movie, but believe it or not this technology exists today. The invention began in the mid 1990s but was brought into discussion as early as the 1960s. The focus of smart dust tech was for military applications. If you research \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Smart Dust\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" the inventor is Dr. Kristofer Pister.\nIn 2001, the American military conducted surveillance test with these devices. Having calculated the speed and direction of military vehicles the test results came back as successful.\nThen in 2004, Dr. Pister shifted the smart dust tech towards commercial applications.\nIt was used to track inventory movement and reduce waiting at checkouts with a reader that tracks everything in a shopping cart and provide a bill to customers. They were also used to detect humidity and temperatures.\nIn 2010 Hewlett-Packard founded the\u00c2\u00a0Central Nervous System of the Earth (CeNSE). Their aim was to launch billions of nanoscale sensors around the world to observe and gather data on the environment and humans.\nThis is what they tell us, so what do you think they're really doing? #research #smartdust #chemtrails #silentweapons #quietwars #society #civilians #wakeup #nanotech #reality #endtimes #markofthebeast #antichristsystem #nwo #zionists",
