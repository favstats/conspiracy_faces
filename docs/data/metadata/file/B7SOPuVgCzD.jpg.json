    "description": "First of all, everyone who rallied in N.J. against S2173, online, in person , who gave out food and hot drinks, who made signs, who posted updates, who took time off work, especially my wife who kept track of this bill, thank you isn\u2019t enough.  Thank you @va_shiva @testa4senate @jamelholley @jacklyn4jc @highwiretalk @joelagananj The video posted from Del Bigtree is very interesting and speaks to the idea that science and doctors are imperfect as we all instinctively know.  The doctors and scientists are speaking from the WHO global vaccine Safety Summit December 2019.  I don\u2019t post this to vilify these scientists however, because they are stating that we need more safety studies to ensure better compliance.  Yet that is the same point families are asking of their children\u2019s doctors. \u201cShow us the long term safety.\u201d \u201cCan this harm my child? \u201c  If the doctors at the top admit (and I appreciate their humility) they DON\u2019T know, then even worse are politicians claiming they know for sure our current multidose, multipharmacy, multi adjuvant vaccine schedule is patently safe!  And to counterbalance , I\u2019m not saying science is bad, or doctors are bad, or politicians are bad, or people who vaccinate are bad.  Summary: Citizens who question safety are not crazy.  They are seeking answers the whole WORLD wants to hear.  And more research needs to be done, esp on LONG TERM adverse events and Combination of doses/manufacturers and adjuvants.
