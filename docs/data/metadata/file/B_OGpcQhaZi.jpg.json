    "description": "Because of the underlying mutual links between #globalwarming hysteria and the #COVID19 panic, it is no wonder that green groups would make statements like this. Greening the world for #SustainableDevelopment, aka #Technocracy, is the red meat of the pandemic.\n\nWorking from home and other measures to help stem the spread of the #coronavirus outbreak in #Britain show how quickly the country could change its ways to address climate change too, participants in the Climate Assembly UK said on Sunday. \u201cWith coronavirus, (the government) has had to act because they had no choice in the matter. With climate change, they need to act in the same way,\u201d said Marc Robson, 46, a British Gas installer and one of the 110 members of the citizens\u2019 assembly.\n\nAs with the response to the COVID-19 respiratory disease, \u201cpeople will die if we don\u2019t do it\u201d, the Newcastle resident warned in a video interview. \u201cAnd we all need to buy into this as well. It needs to be explained to the public that if we don\u2019t change what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s going to cost us, big time.\u201d The assembly, chosen to reflect Britain\u2019s diverse geographic and demographic makeup, as well as different viewpoints on climate change, has met once a month in #Birmingham since January to hear from experts on climate science and policy.\n\nIt is expected to submit over the summer its recommendations to the government on how Britain should meet a legally binding goal to cut its climate-heating emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\nBut with coronavirus restrictions now in place on public gatherings, the assembly this weekend was held for the first time online \u2013 a change some assembly members saw as a \u201ctest run\u201d for potential climate-smart shifts they had been discussing. \u201cThis has opened up my mind that we can make these changes, like working at home,\u201d Robson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nSarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve UK, a charity helping run the assembly, said some members of the group had asked to discuss coronavirus during this weekend\u2019s event and reflect on \u201chow it makes them feel about what they\u2019ve heard\u201d. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Agenda21 #Agenda2030",
