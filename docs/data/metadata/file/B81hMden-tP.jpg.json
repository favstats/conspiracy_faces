    "description": "Out of sight, out of mind \u2014 \u2063\n\u2063\nMost my life, I had lived the way I was taught and what society infused in my brain. \u2063\n\u2063\nTo trust and believe everyone in higher power. To trust professionals always because they have a degree & know what\u2019s best for you. How do they know what\u2019s best for everyone? One size does NOT fit all. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe past 7 months, my eyes have been opened to so many things. And it was all because the day I found out I was pregnant, my motherly intuition prompted me to do my research on so many topics. Topics I\u2019d never even questioned or second guessed before.\u2063\n\u2063\nOut of sight, out of mind. \u2063\n\u2063\nI didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t informed. And now that I am, I cannot unknow what I know. \u2063\n\u2063\nAnd now with any choice, decision, view... I will now KNOW why I am making the choice or not making a choice. I refuse to go with the crowd because everyone tells you to do so \u2014 even those with degrees. \u2063\n\u2063\nThankful for Gods guidance through this all because going against the grain isn\u2019t easy. Especially when you\u2019re a new mama. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo to those who are searching, keep searching. Know your WHY. Know all your options. Seek the Truth. Do what you feel is best for your family for YOU, not to please anyone else. And trust the Lords leading and direction \u2014 no matter where He leads you to because He gave you those God given motherly instincts for a reason... and no degree can trump that. \ud83c\udf3f",
