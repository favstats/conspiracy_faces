    "description": "And this here is why I resent the #blacklivesmatter movement. People always wonder why I don't support BLM even as a black man and George Soros is just one of the reasons why I don't. You don't just pump billions of money into a movement like this, not unless you have an agenda, plus if we dig back, we found out that actblue and BLM are both connected so we can safely assume that whatever donations go to BLM gets siphoned by the democratic party.
