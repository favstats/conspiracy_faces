    "description": "There is currently a massive bravery deficit in society, where people have allowed themselves to be bullied by ideologically driven mobs. Many have decided to bend to the requests of these groups no matter how demeaning or poorly thought out they may be, out of fear of the reputation destruction which the mob is trained in dishing out. This has allowed these ideologies to take hold in virtually every institution.\u2063\n\u2063\nAs far as I can tell the only way out of this is through a genuine counter culture. Individuals and businesses need to begin refusing the ever expanding list of demands thrown at them by radical activists without fear. It needs to become profitable for people to say no, and even take pleasure in mocking the herd like mentality of those who attempt to force their worldview on others as it truly is worthy of ridicule.\u2063\n\u2063",
