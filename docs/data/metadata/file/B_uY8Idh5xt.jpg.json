It\u2019s been five months since we\u2019ve seen the first corona virus headlines in the USA... five months.\nHow long are we going to keep enabling these asshats to control us? We\u2019ve got to stand together, one nation, under God... indivisible!!!!! For freedom and liberty! Or has everyone forgotten the pledge of allegiance we all use to recite in school as children before they took that away from Americans too...???? Wake up before it\u2019s aaaaaaaall gone.
