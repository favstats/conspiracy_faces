    "description": "They sent kids home from school, robbed them of their graduations, games and proms. They created the spike in depression, suicide and abuse cases. They bankrupted our economy.

And we allowed it.\n\n#covid19 #governmentlies #hoax #georgefloyd #justiceforfloyd #medicalfreedom #trump #presidenttrump #trump2020 #trumpgirls #momsfortrump #maga #freedom #makeamericagreatagain #republican #keepamericagreat #trumpeffect #strong #conservative  #USA #merica #america #raisedright  #proudconservative #liberty #patriot #politimamas",
