This is not for McDonald\u2019s nationwide in the mainland.\n\nThe PBoC said last August that their digital yuan was ready to be ruled out.\n\nChina consumers are accustomed to using digital payments. Tech giant Alibaba BABA\u2019s AliPay (owned by Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial) is more ubiquitous in China than Visa and Mastercard. QR code transactions are common place in China.\n\nOn April 20, the WSJ reported that the digital currency rollout would happen outside of the Xiong\u2019an New Area, and also be test driven in Shenzhen and Chengdu.\n\nChina\u2019s estimated 890 million unique mobile payment users made transactions totaling around $20 trillion in 2019. The number of people making mobile merchant payments is expected rise from around 577 million last year to an estimated 700 million in 2022.\n\nChina\u2019s government move into digital payments would potentially be a competitor to AliPay, which is privately owned, though for now the government does not seem to have any plans to roll out a payments platform or a blockchain for those transactions. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
