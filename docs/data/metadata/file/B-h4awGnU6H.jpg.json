    "description": "Hey friends. I\u2019m Rachael. This feels like a big deep breath and a wave to everyone else sailing by. I don\u2019t want to just post whatever for the sake of likes or engagement\u2014 been waiting for the time to take care. Waiting for that peace & focused time. It\u2019s scarce. I don\u2019t want to always be scarce or quiet, waiting to say everything, because there\u2019s almost too much on my heart to condense into one post, sooo if I open the floodgates bit by bit, it\u2019ll come easier. \ud83c\udf0a\nBeen quite a while since I took the time to write a caption \u2014 IG has frozen the past two times I poured my heart out \u2014 and I almost never have time to focus for more than 5-10 min on anything. Nursing a teething toddler round the clock. I have her and a 3 year old, both with big energy levels who rarely nap. They keep me pouring out 24/7 for sure \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nMy worship pastor husband @rockthesales and I recently got a home on wheels we\u2019re renovating to move into full-time in the next 2~ weeks. \ud83d\ude90\nGot some health things \u2014 chemical & mold toxicity due to current rental \u2014 hence the move soon.\nBut in spite of the crazy day-to-day, and the chaotic world outside, we\u2019re taking this time as a family to REST and draw nearer to Yeshua with our prayer and constant worship.\n\u2014\nThese days may seem like the whole world is out of sorts \u2014 which they are, and like with any virus, it\u2019s signifying a deeper cleanse going on globally. I don\u2019t know the full scope, but I will say \u2014\nYahweh\u2019s drawing us nearer to His heart, up out of the previous captivities and idolatry, into REVIVAL. I\u2019m giddy with excitement to think of all He\u2019s doing in each of our hearts \u2014 stirring, awakening, convicting, pruning, cleansing, refining \u2014 sparking a new era of Church from a FAMILY level.\n\u2014\nI\u2019ll save other thoughts for later, but .....! If you\u2019ve read this far, tell me a little about you and why did you decide to follow along?",
