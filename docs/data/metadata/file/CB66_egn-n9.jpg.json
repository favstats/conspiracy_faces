Take action TODAY by following the LINK in our BIO \u2b06\ufe0f above \u2b06\ufe0f to send a pre-drafted, customizable \ud83d\udce9 email to your elected officials, including U.S. Education Secretary #betsydevos; the #illinoisstateboardofeducation and its Superintendent, #carmenayala.\n\u2800\nThe #illinoisdepartmentofpublichealth and the Office of the #Governor have not confirmed and have been unable to produce ANY findings from the #CDC to support the theory that: \u2800\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 #healthy #people wearing cloth face coverings prevents the spread of #illness;\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 forced separation of individuals slows transmission; and\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 #asymptomatic transmission of illness occurs.\n\u2800\nIn other words, there is \ud83d\udeabNO evidence or #scientific data to support that the CDC and the Illinois Department of Public Health have based their guidelines on #science or #medical #evidence.\n\u2800\nThus, these guidelines/considerations, on which Governor Pritzker and the Illinois State Board of Education are basing their guidance, are founded on inconclusive assumptions with \ud83d\udeabNO reputable peer-reviewed studies to support them.\n\u2800\nIf you have a personal perspective to share as a #teacher, #student, #parent or concerned #citizen, please add it to the top section above the provided message. You can also edit the subject line and the pre-drafted message as needed.\n\u2800\nAdditionally, if these measures would cause you to pull your #child from the #Illinois #school system \u2014 or if you are a school #employee considering leaving your position as a result of the measures \u2014 be sure to mention that in your message.\n\u2800\nWhen you are done, please share this important campaign with your friends, #family and #neighbors.\n\u2800\n#standforhealthfreedom #illinoismedicalfreedom #illinoiseducator #wedonotconsent #stand",
