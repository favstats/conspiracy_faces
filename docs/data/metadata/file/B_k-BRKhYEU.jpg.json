    "description": "Five businesses have filed a lawsuit against #Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon, accusing them of violating #constitutionalrights by imposing a #stayathome order to curb the spread of #COVID19, the disease caused by the CCP (#ChineseCommunistParty) virus.\n\nLaw firm Butzel Long filed the suit (pdf) at the U.S. District Court, Western District of Michigan\u2014Southern Division, on Monday.
