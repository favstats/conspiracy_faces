    "description": "I'd like to address the hysteria surrounding the #CoronaVirus because people are beyond consumed with the #FearPorn being shoved down their throats right now that they don't take the time to look rationally at the situation.\n.\nThe virus itself is little more then the average flu, which while unpleasant, is not the end of the world for anyone with a even partially healthy immune system, which is nearly everyone.\n.\nIf you are truly concerned with not being able to survive something equivalent to the flu, you should consider adopting a healthier lifestyle which would allow your body and immune system to function optimally so that viruses wouldn't be such a threat to your well being.\n.\nHow this virus came to be and the many rabbit holes surrounding it is for another post but as for your personal wellbeing; this is nothing to fear, unless like with any other illness, you are someone with preexisting health issue such as a vacinated child, person with chronic disease or elderly person who is already not in good health(also consider how alkaline or acidic your diet is \ud83d\udd11).\n.\nAll this to say, don't buy into the #fearmongering\n& #propaganda because it's not doing you or your immune system any good and really doesn't deserve your focus or energy in the first place but here are 4 BASIC things you can do to increase your overall health so that like me, you don't give a f#%k about #TheCoronaVirus \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb\n.\n1. EAT ORGANIC & RAW FRUITS, VEGETABLES & GREENS AS WELL AS SUPERFOODS, HERBS AND NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS \ud83e\udd5d\ud83e\udd57\ud83c\udf75\n2. DRINK IONIZED ALKALINE OR FRESH SPRING WATER \ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf0a\n3. EXERCISE DAILY \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc83\n4. GET SUNLIGHT \u2728\ud83c\udf1e\u2728",
