The film she starred in \u201cPlademic\u201d was made by director Mikki Willis  he\u2019s awesome!  MIKKI Just interviewed me a few weeks ago.\n\nHonored to be interviewing our friend Dr Judy on my upcoming new show!! :) \n\nHere\u2019s the deets from CNN (Who is not happy about it. \n\nThe show  is set to air on stations across the country in a segment during the program \"\"America This Week\"\" hosted by Eric Bolling. The show, which is posted online before it is broadcast over the weekend, is distributed to Sinclair Broadcast Group's network of local television stations, one of the largest in the country. A survey by Pew Research Group earlier this year showed that local news was a vital source of information on the coronavirus for many Americans, and more trusted than the media overall.\n\nIn this week's episode of the show, Bolling spoke with Judy Mikovits, the medical researcher featured in the discredited \"\"Plandemic\"\" video that went viral earlier this year and which was banned from platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. Throughout the segment, the on-screen graphic read, \"\"DID DR. FAUCI CREATE COVID-19?\"\"\n\nplandemic #healthnutnews #erinelizabeth #healthfreedom #medicalfreedom #talkrevolution",
