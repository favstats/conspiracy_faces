    "description": "All my teenage life I found myself on antidepressants, anxiolytics, and stomach/reflux meds as I battled anorexia (and would sometimes purge). Multiple endoscopies and a colonoscopy later, I came back positive at 17 for Barrett\u2019s esophagus. \u2063\n\u2063\nBarrett\u2019s esophagus involves abnormal changes in the cells lining the esophagus and Can be precancerous. Prior to that diagnosis, I had been on years of proton pump inhibitors medications and literally was starving myself \ud83e\udd74\u2063\n\u2063\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications that suppress gastric acid production - such as Nexium, Prevaid, Prisolec and Protonix. They are known for the following adverse effects:\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2705 induce magnesium and iron deficiency\u2063\n\u2705 increased fracture risk\u2063\n\u2705 increased risk of SIBO\u2063\n\u2705 increased risk of serious gut infections such as Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile\u2063\n\u2705 facilitated gut dysbiosis\u2063\n\u2705 increased risk of death (and recent studies show increased stroke risk \u2063\n\u2705 increased risk of micronutrient deficiency, especially B vitamins \u2063\n\u2063\nIt wasn\u2019t until I found the book Gut and Psychology Syndrome by Dr Natasha McBride that I realized how much my gut health was affecting my mental state...even the eating disorder. That began my path of integrative medicine and healing a leaky gut \u2764\ufe0f\u2063\n\u2063\nNext week I\u2019ll be doing a free workshop where you can learn about leaky gut, resources and tools to support healing, essential oils and supplements I have used to help and nutrition tips.
