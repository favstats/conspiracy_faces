    "description": "I was in the garage painting with Charlotte when it really hit me. \nI do not like to post about (or talk about for that matter) politics bc to me, the majority of it is all just lies & bullshit. BUT as I look at my sweet, carefree daughter, I remember that it was those before me who were BRAVE enough to speak out, that aided in the ability for her to live this life. \nI have always tried to keep my account real & raw & honest as I navigate my way through motherhood, but I have failed you. Up until now, I have been a complete coward. Throughout this past month-and-a-half, I\u2019ve allowed others to fight in the trenches, while I sat hiding in the shadows. All because I was too scared of being burnt at the stake by my social media \u201cfriends.\u201d Well, friends, I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m sick of hiding, I\u2019m sick of disappointing myself, & I\u2019m sick of teaching my daughter to be bold & brave while not being bold & brave myself. \nThere is a A LOT of messed up stuff going on right under our noses right now, but what I\u2019m talking about here, are the plans @thisisbillgates has in store for us...it\u2019s real & it\u2019s important & #IdoNotConsent. I #SayNoToBillGates bc I will not let some not-a-doctor billionaire be in charge of my (or my daughter\u2019s) health/body/life. #NoNewNormal\n*If you\u2019re unaware of what\u2019s been going on with Bill, & you\u2019re interested, DM me for ALLLLLL the deets. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\nHappy earrings by @holaguava \ud83d\udc8b \ud83c\udf08",
