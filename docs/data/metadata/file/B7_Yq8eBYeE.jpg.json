    "description": "#HillaryClinton\u2019s team have finally accepted legal documents in connection with a $50 million defamation lawsuit bought by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate #TulsiGabbard, the #Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s lawyer told Fox News on Thursday night. \u201cWe look forward to finally moving forward on the merits\u201d of the case, said Brian Dunne, lead attorney representing Gabbard, who is suing over #Clinton indirectly smearing her as a \u201c#Russian asset\u201d during an October interview.\n\nFox report: The development comes after Hillary Clinton and her representatives refused to accept the papers in three previous attempts to serve them, Dunne said. \u201cToday, after the media picked up this story, Ms. Clinton\u2019s lawyer changed course and agreed to accept service,\u201d Dunne told Fox News in a statement. \u201cWe would have preferred that Ms. Clinton just accept federal judicial process in the first instance, without having to be called out by the press, but in any event, Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s lawsuit against her will now be moving forward.\u201d Fox News left written and phone messages late Thursday for Clinton attorney David Kendall of the Washington law firm Williams & Connolly LLP but did not receive a response.\n\nAt a campaign event in Portsmouth, N.H., on Thursday evening, Gabbard hadn\u2019t yet heard that Clinton\u2019s team accepted the legal papers. \u201cThe latest that I\u2019ve heard is that it\u2019s what\u2019s been reported, that she has refused to be served the documents related to the lawsuit,\u201d Gabbard told reporters. \u201cI think this is unfortunate, you know. No one is above the law. This lawsuit is about accountability \u2013 not just for me but for all service members and for the #American people.\u201d Clinton had said in an October 2019 interview that one of the Democratic presidential candidates was \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d and was being groomed as a third-party candidate for the 2020 general election in November.\n\nClinton never mentioned Gabbard by name, but when asked to confirm whether the former first lady was referring to Gabbard, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill responded at the time, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits \u2026 \u201d a reference to popular Russian dolls. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#HillaryForPrison",
