    "description": "\u201cThe problem is not the message and how you [Andy] tell it, and you tell it in a brilliant way in this film, a very compelling way... the problem is how do you get people to see it?  Because the media is out there and their job is to make sure nobody sees this stuff.  And that\u2019s really the problem... the censorship. \nWe know how to talk about this in a way that\u2019s very compelling, the problem is we\u2019re not allowed to write about it in the newspapers, we\u2019re not allowed to talk about it on radio or television, and we now are completely censored on social media.\u201d -Robert F.
