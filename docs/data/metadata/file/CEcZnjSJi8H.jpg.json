I\u2019ve been wondering:\nHave the current events had you looking at things differently and questioning more?\nAre you even questioning things, maybe not, maybe just going with the flow?\nIf you are looking at this saying, this isn\u2019t right,have you always been this way, asking questions and challenging the narrative?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe shirt: it\u2019s from Target... I went on a spending freeze, other than necessities, at the beginning of all this (I do this sometimes) but when looking online for shoes for one of my girls, I found the T and thought it basically had my name on it. When it came, I quickly grabbed it before my strong willed one could read the quote and told her it said \u201cnever question your mother!\u201d \ud83e\udd23\n\nHappy Friday guys... thanks for voting in the polls.. and answering all my questions, it\u2019s the weekend! Let\u2019s be happy and find some joy!",
