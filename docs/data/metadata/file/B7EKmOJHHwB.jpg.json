It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy for them to twist a story from a 3rd world country because not a lot of people in Amerikkka have access to the REAL news that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening there. A couple of years ago when I was in the Philippines, my mom called me and asked where I was and if I was safe and I said why? And she told me the US news was saying that there was an active shooter at a mall that was 20 min from where I was staying in the Philippines. But when we heard the real news in the Philippines, it was just a fire that broke out at the mall. Just a little example of how the media twist EVERYTHING LITTLE THING! #hollyweirdisevil #iran #trump",
