    "description": "Notorious left-wing billionaire #GeorgeSoros has labeled the #coronaviruspandemic \u201cthe crisis of my lifetime\u201d and indicated that the global crisis has provided the opportunity for radical changes to society previously thought impossible.\n\nSoros, who lived through the Second World War as a youth, said, \u201cEven before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible, but probably absolutely necessary.\u201d During the interview on May 11, Soros also said \u201cI will also say that I have put my faith in Trump to destroy himself, and he has exceeded my wildest expectations,\u201d Soros added.\n\nWhile the constitution, according to Soros, \u201cwill prevent him from doing certain things,\u201d that has not stopped the President from trying, \u201cbecause he is literally fighting for his life.\u201d Radical left sponsor and billionaire George Soros says #PresidentTrump is \u201cliterally fighting for his life.\u201d\nLifeSiteNews report: Soros was \u201cparticularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.\u201d While, according to the #Hungarian-born billionaire, the #EuropeanUnion was \u201cin the process of being created,\u201d that process \u201cwas never completed.\u201d Thus, Soros said the EU was \u201cexceptionally vulnerable \u2013 more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.\u201d Soros also commented on a recent conflict between Germany and the EU. Germany\u2019s highest court had ruled on May 5 that one of the EU\u2019s Court of Justice decisions regarding policies of the European Central Bank (ECB) was not legally binding. In turn, the European Court of Justice asserted that it alone had jurisdiction over the ECB.\n\nIn the interview, Soros sided with the EU. \u201cWhen Germany joined the EU, it committed itself to abide by European law,\u201d he argued.\n\nHe voiced his fears that countries like Poland or Hungary might become more independent of the EU, if also \u201cthe German court can question the decisions of the European Court of Justice.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#SocioEconomicReformation",
