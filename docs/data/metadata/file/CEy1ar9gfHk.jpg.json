Minnie and his good friend Chris Steyn, also a former cop turned investigative journalist, worked together on the book to expose a government\u00c2\u00a0and business community who took children to Bird Island where they were abused, and some possibly murdered.\nThe book details the level of their involvement in the pedophile ring, abuse of the children, alleged acts of murder to cover up the crimes, as well as corruption and abuse of high-level state resources by the network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members.\nBefore his death, Minnie announced that he was approached by many more people with even more damning evidence which he planned to reveal in a sequel of the book. However, he died before he could finish it.\n\nThis case is eerily similar to that of a man who was allegedly murdered in Lithuania after he began exposing high-level government pedophiles.When his four-year-old cousin accused two\u00c2\u00a0high-level government officials\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddescribing it in heartbreaking detail\u00e2\u20ac\u201dKorolis Venckien\u00c4\u2014 learned the hard way how the government protects its vilest\u00c2\u00a0members, up to and including using hundreds of militarized police and even murder.\n\n#ourrescue#stopsexualizingchildren \n#pedophiliaculture\n#pedophiliaisnotasexuality\n#childrenarenotsexobjects\n#ourrescue #saveourchildren #awareness #aware #childtrafficking #truth #truthbetold #elitepedorings #fallofthecabal #ourchildrenarenotforsale #nonewnormal #wedonotconsent #hollywierd #burnhollywood #seesomthingsaysomthing #endhumantrafficking #endchildtrafficking",
