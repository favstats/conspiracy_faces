    "description": "An #Oregon judge has declared #coronavirus restrictions enacted by Gov. Kate Brown (D) \"\"\"\"null and void\"\"\"\" because her emergency orders weren't approved by the state legislature after 28 days, according to KJW8.\n\n#BakerCounty Circuit Judge Matthew Shirtcliff made the ruling Monday in a lawsuit brought by churches who had sued saying the #socialdistancing directives were #unconstitutional.\n\nThe suit had also argued that emergency powers only last for a month and after that Brown would have needed legislative approval. The judge agreed. -KJW8\n\nBrown says she will immediately appeal the ruling with the state Supreme Court, which would \"\"\"\"ensure we can continue to safeguard the health of all #Oregonians \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including frontline health care workers, those living in nursing homes, workers in agriculture and food processing plants, and Oregonians with underlying health conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201c while the legal process moves forward.\"\"\"\" An attorney representing churches, Ray Hacke, said during a Monday phone interview that the ruling nullifies Brown's ban on church gatherings for worship - but also invalidates the entire stay-at-home order. \"\"\"\"The #stayathome order is no longer in effect. It is invalidated. If people want to get their haircut, they can. They can leave their home for any reason whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deemed essential in the eye of the state or not,\"\"\"\" he said, adding that the ruling was a vindication for both the freedom of religion and that of all Oregonians. \"\"\"\" Praise God. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m excited, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad that the judge saw that there are limitations on the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power, even in the midst of emergencies,\"\"\"\" said Hacke. #PowerToThePeople",
