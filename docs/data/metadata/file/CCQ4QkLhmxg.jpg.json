Does freedom mean mandates? Does freedom mean getting your business that you've worked so hard for shut down? Does freedom mean forcing medical procedures that come with risks onto others? Does freedom mean removing religious exemptions to attend school and thus forcing you to homeschool your kids? Does freedom mean censoring others because it does not suit the agenda ahead? Do these things make you feel free?\n\u2022\nThis is the OPPOSITE of freedom. We are so far from free. What happened to freedom of religion? Freedom of speech? This is not what our country was intended to be. We need to bring 4th change and put more effort into our future and the future of our children. Speak up, go to that march, educate, do not comply.. Whatever we need to do!\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u201dWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. \u201d\nReposted from @growingthefam and @gary4trump",
