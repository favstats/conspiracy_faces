    "description": "Thoughts?\nAttorney General William Barr says he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the draconian \u2018Digital Vaccine Certificates\u2018 plan being pushed by Bill Gates in response to the #coronavirus pandemic.\nIn an interview Wednesday with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham, Barr assured that the federal government is \u201ckeeping an eye\u201d on the temporary restrictions imposed by state and local governments during the outbreak, and warned that officials should be \u201cvery careful to make sure that the #draconian measures that are being adopted are fully justified.\u201d \u201cWhen this period of time, at the end of April, expires, I think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have, and not just tell people to go home and hide under their bed, but allow them to use other ways \u2014 social distancing and other means \u2014 to protect themselves,\u201d he said.\nInfoWars.com reports: Interestingly, Barr said he was actually concerned about the \u201ctracking of people\u201d proposed by Bill Gates and others:\nIngraham: Bill Gates, the Gates Foundation are in favor of developing digital certificates that would certify that individuals, #American citizens, have an immunity to this virus and potentially other viruses going forward to then facilitate travel and work and so forth. What are your thoughts from a civil libertarian point of view about these types of \u2013 what some would say tracking mechanisms that would be adopted going forward to reopen our broader economy?\nBarr: Yeah, I\u2019m very concerned about the slippery slope in terms of continuing encroachments on personal liberty. I do think during the emergency, appropriate, reasonable steps are fine.\nIngraham: But a digital certificate to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has \u2013 of people who\u2019ve received it. That\u2019s his answer in a Reddit ask me anything. They had a little forum.\nBarr: Yeah, I\u2019d be a little concerned about that, the tracking of people and so forth, generally, especially going forward over a long period of time.\nRead More: [https://newspunch.com/ag-barr-concerned-about-bill-gates-vaccine-certificates-plan-draconian-lockdown-must-end/] #MarkOfTheBeast #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
