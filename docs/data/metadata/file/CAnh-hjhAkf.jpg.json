    "description": "So far, the #Chinese #coronavirus has killed over 342,000 worldwide, destroyed economies, and impoverished small business owners, yet #WorldHealthOrganization (W.H.O.) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was praised by #China for his efforts.\n\n#Beijing\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi said that Tedros has done a good job and countries \u201cwith decency\u201d will support him and the W.H.O. in its future work.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Wang claimed the W.H.O. was beyond reproach but failed to offer a single fact to back his claim. \u201cWe hope all countries will realize that humanity is a community with a shared future.\u201d \u201cWe must render each other more support and cooperation, and there should be less accusation and confrontation,\u201d he added. \u201cWe call on all nations to come together and build a better world for all,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for W.H.O.\u2019s international standing and its place in history, I\u2019m sure clear-eyed people the world over will reach a fair conclusion, one that will not be altered just because some country doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d Breitbart.com reports: Those who throw mud at the W.H.O. will only leave a stain on themselves, said Wang, in defiance of a host of countries who see nothing but hopeless mismanagement almost from the first day the virus was isolated.\n\nU.S. health secretary Alex Azar has already blamed the W.H.O. for not obtaining or providing the information needed to stem the pandemic. \u201cWe must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control: there was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\u201d he said earlier this month.\n\nThe evidence backs that assertion.\n\nAs far back as January 14, two months after health officials are believed to have detected the first case of the virus in China on November 17 of last year, the W.H.O. was promoting a Chinese claim via Twitter that there was \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
