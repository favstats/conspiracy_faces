I don\u2019t know the answer yet, but I have my suspicions. Are politicians and others using this situation for their own purposes? You and I both know the answer to that question. You already see how it is used today\u2026Doesn\u2019t it seem to you that the powerful forces of the world would like to remake the world, without a \u2018war\u2019\u00a0\n.\n.\n.\n#nwo #newworldorder #belaruspresident #scamdemic #covert19 #certificateofvaccination #billgates #arrestbillgates #filmyourhospital #crimesagainsthumanity #agenda2030 #jewworldorder #zionistagenda #jewnation #wedonotconsent #markofthebeast #imf #who",
