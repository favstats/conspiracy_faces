    "description": "This is Willow. She died 8 days after receiving the CDC recommended hepatitis B vaccine/vitamin k injection when she was born. Her cause of death was ruled as positional asphyxiation from co-sleeping. The truth, baby Willow was swaddled and laid down (with nothing else around her) while mom and dad brushed their teeth, when they finished and returned to the bedroom just a few minutes later, Willow was nonresponsive.\n\nWillow was born a vibrant, healthy baby after a normal pregnancy. Despite the gamut of testing done, no true cause of death was determined, so SIDS is the resulting label. Healthy babies are not dying from co-sleeping with nothing/nobody in the bed with them. They aren't dying from undetermined causes. The industry just doesn't want to make the determination because it would require them to admit that their entire system is faulty. They've dug themselves too deep and they know if they disclose the truth now, every parent with a brain will begin to question and reject their schemes.\n\nVaccines, and the vitamin K injection, all list death as a possibility. Their inserts all spell out a laundry list of risks, some severe and lifelong. It's time to start looking at the facts, the science, the parental reports. It's time to wake up and see this for what it is. Does it make more sense that these babies are dying from SIDS and unknown causes or that the onslaught of toxins we are injecting them with, that are known to cause brain swelling and respiratory arrest, are the more likely culprits? \n#HealthyBabiesDontJustDie\n#NursesSpeakUp #believemothers \n#DoctorsSpeakUp #nonewnormal",
