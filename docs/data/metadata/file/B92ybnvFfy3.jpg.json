    "description": "For every demand to vaccinate for the sake of \u201cherd immunity\u201d there is a wail from a mother that experienced the death of her child or a v*x injury that now has changed the trajectory of her child\u2019s life. Just because the media doesn\u2019t want to put a spotlight on the opposite side of their funded agenda, it doesn\u2019t mean v*x injuries and death do not exist.\n\nIn fact, the lack of coverage over the reality some mothers live through due to a v*x causes those mothers to rally together and lash out, making them appear loud and possibly obnoxious to those who do not understand their agony. It\u2019s not misinformation or lack of knowledge in the women you hear when they cry out, it\u2019s raw pain and real tragedy.\n\nMothers do not scream out of hurt or shout out of anger without a reason.\n\nMothers do not create uproar without purpose.\n\nMothers do not plead out of desperation without pain from experience.\n\nJust because the life they are courageously walking through is invisible to others, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. It doesn\u2019t mean their experience isn\u2019t real. It doesn\u2019t mean their child matters less than any other child.\n\nListen to mothers. Their cries are not fueled by profit. Their cries are fueled by pain.\n\nAll children matter. All mothers matter. On both sides. So, let\u2019s meet here in the middle and quit creating chaos long enough to realize this movement is much more complex than fully surrendering to one perspective.\n\nWe are facing another crossroads today, but the opportunity you have, in this very moment, is to write your own story, from this day forward.\n\n#believemothers",
