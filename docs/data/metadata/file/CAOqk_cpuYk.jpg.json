To tell me to \u201cbe quiet.\u201d To #science on my post and attempt to make me feel small or stupid.\n\nIt won\u2019t work.\n\nThey ask questions as if they genuinely want an answer, when their real goal to keep me busy replying to them and drain my energy.\n\nThey try to shift my focus from engaging with those who want to listen. People who are ready to restore freedom. People who are ready to let the PEOPLE choose.\n\nIf you choose to take a stand right now, to speak up, no matter how kind your voice. I can guarantee four things:\n1. It WON\u2019T be easy.\n2. People WILL try to silence you.\n3. You WILL have to fight hard to respond lovingly or not at all.\n4. You won\u2019t be alone!\n\nNow is the time for a backbone, thick skin, a big heart, loud voice and a lot of prayer.\n\nIt is not a time for silence or fear of other\u2019s opinions of you.\n\nWhat you will experience, if you decide to take a stand, will be uncomfortable but it\u2019s worth the discomfort.  Speak up for your children. For your family. For yourself. For freedom.",
