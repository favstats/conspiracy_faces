    "description": "Breaking. Many stores, Some not even included here have changed their policy that stated they would not serve people who are not wearing masks. Several nonprofit and groups representing folks with disabilities spoke up and it sounds like they listened. What are your thoughts on this? I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been inside any kind of retail store or any store or restaurant of any kind for months. I do curbside and pick up. Makes life much easier and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to deal with humans as much.Know the feeling? #HealthNutNews #HolisticHealth #NaturalHealth #ErinElizabeth #MedicalChoice #HealthFreedom #MedicalFreedom #Vaccines",
