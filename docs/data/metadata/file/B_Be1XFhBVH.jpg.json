    "description": "A re-enactment photo of a photo I took two years ago entitled \u201cHot Naps,\u201d which has since been my profile picture. Sans bleached hair and blue eyes; a warmer version - my hair is no longer bleached, but rather completely natural. My eyes are more green as a result, and less blue. I love how my eyes change colors like that. Again by the pool, on a very hot day, fresh out of a nap, with a bit more cleavage \u2728 drinkwaterwithnicole.com for beauty water\ud83d\udca6",
