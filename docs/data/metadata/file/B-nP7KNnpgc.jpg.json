    "description": "In Oct\n-\nThoughts?\n\nNot long before #Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The #JohnsHopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the #WorldEconomicForum and the #BillandMelindaGatesFoundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called \u201c#Event201\u201d that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what\u2019s now transpiring with the #coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on #NewYorkCity to discuss how they would respond to \u201ca severe pandemic\u201d much like the one we\u2019re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.\n\nThe exercise \u201cillustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,\u201d an official announcement from Event 201 reads. \u201cIn recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,\u201d the announcement goes on to explain. \u201cThese events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.\u201d According to the event\u2019s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires \u201ccooperation\u201d among governments, industries, and \u201ckey international institutions\u201d \u2013 the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIs coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the \u201cherd\u201d and sell more vaccines?\n\nThe timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It\u2019s even eclipsing President Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out \u2013 a best-case scenario \u2013 or spreading like wildfire. #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda\n\u267b\ufe0f @freedom_faction",
