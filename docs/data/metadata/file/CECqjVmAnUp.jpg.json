Like maybe that goes away if I\u2019m not in a white coat in an office? \u2063\n\u2063\nIt honestly annoyed every time someone asked because I worked my ass off for that degree and the ability to write prescriptions and even though I don\u2019t use it in the same capacity as what may be expected, doesn\u2019t mean I no longer can. But regardless...\u2063\n\u2063\nThen I wondered why we feel as women so often that choosing against the grain, choosing to be at home, not being a \u201ccareer\u201d woman...why does that often have us feeling less than? Is it what society says we should be? Is it frowned upon in our social circles? Why do i feel so defensive?\u2063\n\u2063\nI run a million dollar business, I\u2019m a six figure entrepreneur earner, and nothing about my life looks like I ever thought it would or should. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s great actually. And even if I didn\u2019t have my nurse practitioner, I would still be enough. If i wasnt a work from home mom or not using my degree, it would be enough.\u2063\n\u2063\nI guess I\u2019m letting you know today that those pieces of your life that nobody sees: they are worthy. You are worthy. You are deserving. No matter what society says. You teaching and raising your kids. It\u2019s enough.\u2063\n\u2063\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#youareenough \n#wellnessjourney\n#idahomom \n#positivityisthekey \n#womenempowermentquotes \n#femaleownedbusiness \n#younglivingbusiness \n#nursesofig \n#medicalfreedomactivist \n#femaleentrepreneurs",
