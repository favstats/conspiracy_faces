    "description": "I will be giving a 20-minute lecture on the principles of malpractice law and avoiding lawsuits in aesthetic dermatology tomorrow (Tuesday) at 5pm EST (Boston time) on Instagram live. The principles apply to all fields of medicine. Up to 75% of physicians in low-risk specialties will face a lawsuit during the course of their career. As physicians, we have little to no training on the law. I went to Cornell Law School and practiced law for three years prior to medical school. I will provide a brief overview of some of the basic principles you need to know. While this talk will not be providing actual legal advice or counsel, I think it may provide a basic framework for facing these issues at a time when teaching opportunities are limited.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#malpractice #lawsuit #healthlaw #informedconsent #medmal #resipsaloquitur #medicolegal",
