    "description": "I miss my Cubs baseball!! And if I have to miss my Chicago Bears or my Iowa Hawkeyes and UNI Panthers football season I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m gonna start a revolt.  Working in the industry that I do, I see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening more than some. Somewhat joking aside(about sports), people are losing their businesses right and left, families are hit much harder than this virus alone. We are going to see a much bigger problem if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open back up soon.  Our country is no longer free if our government keeps telling us what to do.  Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call me unsympathetic because if you know me you know that i am one of the most sympathetic and empathetic person.  If not well fuck you. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want anymore death than anyone else now, or during the regular flu season that every year kills thousands and thousands of people.  Cancer, heart attacks, diabetes and the list goes on and on. *\n*\n#fuckyoucoronavirus #missbaseball #chicagocubs #chicagobears #iowahawkeyes #unipanthers #openthecountrybackup #sports #washyoutdamnhands #practicegoodhygiene #healthy #livehealthy #fitgirl #fitmom #girlswholift #girlswithmuscle #gameday #fuckbillgates #dontbesheep #freedom #fightforsmallbusiness",
