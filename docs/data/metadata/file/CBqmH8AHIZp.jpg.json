I wanted to start much more simply. There is quite a ton to digest in this video. And, of course, much that cannot be proven. Unfortunately, I am only being given white screens and error messages while trying to pull up anything from this app today. I happen to have this video saved\u2026 So here you go. Take what resonates with you and leave the rest. No need to be aggressive in the comments. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\nI do not have a link or the information for the original video. If anybody finds it\u2026 Please DM it to me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd #wwg1wga #pedogateisreal #podestaemails #qanon #truthtolight \n#followthewhiterabbit #pedowoodisreal #pizzagateisreal #declass #voterfraud  #thegreatawakening #thesepeoplearesick #killary #clintonfoundation #operationmockingbird #pedogate #spiritcooking #epsteindidntkillhimself #hisnamewassethrich #maga2020 #whatisQ #okpedo",
