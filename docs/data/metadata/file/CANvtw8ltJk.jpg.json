    "description": "Dear world. We've overreacted. It's not too late to admit we were wrong and do the right thing. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO DO THE RIGHT THING (lessons I teach my children). Final straw? Telling kids that school won't be returning to normal come fall and to expect \"\"\"\"some big changes.\"\"\"\" Our kids are NOT meant to live 6 feet apart from their friends. NO ONE IS. It's far more deadly than a virus.\n\nConclusion: Reality worldwide does not fit the narrative/fear.\n\nWe had the flu, guys. We'll be fine. I bet you $1000 I'd test positive for antibodies today and chances are you would too...because that's how healthy bodies work. Expose. Fight. Recover. Be stronger. SMART creations we are. But nobody is talking about how to have a healthy body, so I'll happily help there (in no particular order). 1) Limit the toxic crap. \n2) Eat real food. \n3) Give your body nutrition/support it needs. \n4) Go outside. \n5) HUG PEOPLE. \n6) Laugh. \n7) Sleep. \n8) Don't take drugs (or Vaxschemes). 9) Turn off the news. \n10) Think for yourself (you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think)\n11) PRAY\n\nTHESE THINGS MATTER...but the MSM says NOTHING of these things. Why???? Seriously. WHY?\n\nMayyyyybe it's just me, but I have a feeling there a LOT of people who feel the same. Our babies are paying the price with their childhood, inheriting a massive debt, FEAR programming changing their DNA, and we're all paying with our mental well-being & forever freedom.\n\nSHOW'S OVER.\nEND IT NOW.\nOpen up all the things.\n\nGo take your vitamins, and hug a friend. You'll feel much better. \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b",
