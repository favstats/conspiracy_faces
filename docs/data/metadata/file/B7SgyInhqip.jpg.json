Who gathers information. Who doesn't follow norms for the sake of norms. I've also (in my adult years) been on a pursuit of full health. I would go to the naturopath before the doctor. I birthed with midwives in tubs and birthing centres. I cloth diapered my babies and breastfed as long as possible. I didn't use soap on my babies. Didn't feed rice cereals or grains for babies. Delayed first foods. My babies slept in my bed .... and one still does. \u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nHow did I miss this? How did I not question vaccines as much as the birthing process? How did I remove the natural?\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nWhy was I not as big an advocate of lead in lipstick AND aluminium being injected in to babies? The latter is worse. The effects detrimental.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nI advocate for toxin reform day in and day out - but didn't do the due diligence to read the excipient list on vaccines.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nI missed the target. I felt like an imposter. I often still do. How can you trust me when I made such a huge mistake? How can I trust myself?\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nThe thing is: it's not about me. It's about you. I'm owning my story. You will need to own yours. I want to use the story I wish we didn't have - so that you can learn and make informed choices yourself. \u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nWhere do I wish I had started? 1) the excipient list. 2) the book called \"\"Dissolving Illusions\"\" 3) @believemothers instagram because it connects story to people. \u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nWhere will you start?\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\nPhoto credit @heima_photography \u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\n..\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n.\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n#zerowaste #recycle #saveourworld #carbonfootprint\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\u2060\u2800\n#realmamahood #autoimmune #detox #beauty #toxinfree #greenbeauty #informedconsent #freedomkeepers #wildandfree #thatsdarling #darlingdaily #thehappynow #livethelittlethings #believemothers #freedomkeeper #momlife #enchatedchildhood #motherhoodblog #thecreativecollective #yycmoms #beautyblogger\u2060\u2800\u2060#thisisredding\u2060\u2800\u2060.\u2060\u2800",
