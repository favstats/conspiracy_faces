    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nIn an appearance with Bloomberg Tuesday, Bill Gates once again dismissed anyone who questions the motives of his global #coronavirus vaccination push as a \u2018conspiracy theorist,\u2019 calling them \u201cso crazy\u201d.\n\nHost Erik Schatzker stated that \u201cThe #conspiracytheorists who believe that you helped to create and spread the Corona virus might be easy to dismiss. If there weren\u2019t so many of them,\u201d before asking \u201chas that notoriety become an impediment to your efforts or the foundation\u2019s work yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s so crazy to suggest the opposite which is you know we make vaccines and that has save millions of lives to somehow say that the vaccine in general is malign or that you know that the deaths are really taking place,\u201d Gates stated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me how interesting that is. It spreads far more quickly than the truth,\u201d he added.\n\nGates attempted to conflate questions over vaccines to those who refuse to wear masks in public, stating \u201cThe big concern is that if that means that the protection of others like wearing masks or a willingness of enough people to take the vaccine then it absolutely does make things worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the idea of how should these social media platforms try and avoid being the source. These sort of weirdly interesting falsehoods. That\u2019s a debate or discussion we\u2019re going to we\u2019re going to have to continue to have,\u201d Gates added.\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising however, that mistrust of Gates\u2019 vaccines continues to spread, given accounts like a recent admission by the UN that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing the outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out.\n\nIn the same interview, Gates suggested that while it is \u2018weird\u2019 for people to mistrust his vaccines, Americans should not trust the FDA or the CDC, reasoning that they are linked to the President, and are politicising the virus.\n\nRead More: [https://summit.news/2020/09/16/video-bill-gates-pushes-global-vaccination-says-covid-conspiracy-theories-are-so-crazy/] #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #VaccineAgenda\n\nRepost @freedom_faction",
