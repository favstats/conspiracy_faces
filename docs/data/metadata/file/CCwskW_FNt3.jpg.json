They are currency. And I\u2019m sad to say this practice seems to be becoming more and more open in those circles in recent years.\u201c\n.\nKeanu Reeves, whose younger sister suffered from leukemia, finds it \u201cinconceivable\u201d that anybody could \u201cbe so selfish as to destroy a young person\u2019s life for your own personal pleasure.\u201d\n.\n\u201cBut that is the sort of person running Hollywood,\u201d said Reeves, who donated 70% of his earnings from the Matrix trilogy to hospitals treating children with cancer. \u201cThese people are sociopaths, pure and simple.\u201d\n.\n\u201cThey see it as the ultimate high. They say it gives them life. The more the child suffered, the more fear and hormonal adrenaline it had in its system at the time of death, the stronger the effect on the people who consume that blood. They live for this stuff.\u201c\n.\nAccording to Reeves, the number of Hollywood elites who engage in the ritual abuse of children and the practice of drinking their blood is not insignificant.\n.\n\u201cSome of these guys carry around bottles of blood. They call it \u2018red wine.\u2019 But they don\u2019t hide it.\u201c\n.\n\u201cFrom what I understand there is a supply chain that delivers young children on the regular. I\u2019ve heard them refer to times of famine, times of feast.\u201c\n.\n#panic #amazongate #wayfair #wayfairgate #childsextrafficking #pedogate #pizzagate #pizzagateisreal #endhumantrafficking #prayforthechildren #darktolight #ritualabuse #andrenochrome #jeffreyepstein #stlittlejames #epstein #epsteinflightlogs #l",
