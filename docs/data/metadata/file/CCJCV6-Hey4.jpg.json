    "description": "Parents, my heart goes out to you all. I say this with the most love I can muster up...How did they take your children and you're still alive?!? How did they get away with their lives?? WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. EVER. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. This is a hill that all parents should be willing to die on. I promise you they would not get off my property alive if they come for my kids. I don't care what happens to me. we have people we love that can care for our children if anything happens to us. So, I will fight til the death on THIS hill. #WAKEUP #DoSomething #ReadyYourselves #ArmYourselves #ProtectYourChildren #AtAllCost #ParentalRights",
