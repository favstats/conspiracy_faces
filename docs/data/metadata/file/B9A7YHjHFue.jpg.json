    "description": "Reposted from @intellectual_lecture101 Every picture is worth 1,000 words they say. This is the alleged \"\"last picture\"\" taken of #Tupac moments before he was killed(go figure). As you can clearly see tho, Suge Knight is driving his 7 series #BMW without any keys in the ignition.\n.\nI'm at the point now where I think the #elites who propagate these hoaxes leave little mistakes like this on purpose. They know that people are in such a trance from their #media outlets that no one will question their \"\"official story\"\" and blindly believe everything they tell them. #Pictures like these remind me of the games like 'find what's missing' or 'find the one that's different'. Knowing what i know now about childhood games, it would make sense that exercises like those are really tools used to test the sharpness of our analytic skills. This way they can assess the public's ability to discern through misinformation and fabricated stories.\n.\nJust like most if not all of the celebrity idols people worship. Tupac faked his death as a form of retirement for the #hollywood elite. With \"\"tragic deaths\"\" like pac, biggie, xxxtentacion, mac miller, etc, etc, the industry keeps the masses cleverly distracted with events that aren't based in truth. The point of these hoax stories is to keep you emotionally unstable and on a low frequency. If the elite can keep us on a low vibration responding only with our emotions. It ca  hinder our minds from rationalizing information logically. Falling for these stories allows them to tweak our actions based on altering our conscious through our emotions.\n.\nI know for some it's hard to not watch the tv without falling for every altered fact they tell. Which is why I highly advise people to stop watching it if you're unable to discern through the lies and key peices of propaganda they push on us. - #hoax",
