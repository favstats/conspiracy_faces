    "description": "President Trump\u2019s\u00a0longtime adviser Roger Stone said Monday that Bill Gates may have had a hand in the creation of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0so that he could plant microchips in people\u2019s heads to know who has and has not been tested for COVID-19. \u201cWhether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate. I have conservative friends who say it\u2019s ridiculous and others say absolutely,\u201d Stone told Joe Piscopo, host of the radio program \u201cThe Answer\u201d on 970 AM, who had asked about conspiracy theories regarding the pandemic. \u201cHe and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they\u2019ve been tested. Over my dead body. Mandatory vaccinations? No way, Jose!\u201d Stone told Piscopo.",
