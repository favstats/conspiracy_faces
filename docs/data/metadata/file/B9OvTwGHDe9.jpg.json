    "description": "More footage from the shooting at the mall I was at in the Philippines. The shooter was on leave of absence and came back shooting. He also had 30 hostages and a grenade. This was pretty scary considering I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been in a situation like this. He was requesting to have all the security guards lined up outside. Not sure how it ended yet. #Hollyweirdisevil",
