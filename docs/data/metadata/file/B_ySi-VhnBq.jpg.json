Michelle Lujan Grisham has completely banned traffic movement in one western New Mexico city.\n\nOn Friday, Lujan Grisham invoked the state's #RiotControlAct to prohibit all \"\"\"\"nonessential\"\"\"\" traffic movements in the city of #Gallup, the Associated Press reported.\n\nLujan Grisham's lockdown includes a ban on \"\"\"\"routine outings\"\"\"\" and forces businesses to close from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. \"\"\"\"The spread of this virus in McKinley County is frightful,\"\"\"\" Lujan Grisham said. \"\"\"\"And it shows that physical distancing has not occurred and is not occurring. The virus is running amok there. It must be stopped, and stricter measures are necessary.\"\"\"\" The harsh lockdown measures are reportedly meant to slowdown a surging coronavirus outbreak happening in that part of the state, which has significantly impacted the #NavajoNation. Gallup sits on the outskirts of the #Navajo reservation and is a former trading outpost town for the indigenous group.\n\nState police and the #NationalGuard are helping enforce the lockdown order, the AP reported.\n\nViolations of Lujan Grisham's order are punishable as #misdemeanors on the first offense and as felonies upon subsequent violations.\n\nApproximately 70,000 residents live in and around Gallup. The county within which Gallup is located, #McKinleyCounty, is responsible for roughly one-third of all #COVID19 cases in New Mexico, according to the Farmington Daily Times.\n\nThe lockdown was originally set to expire Monday at noon. However, Lujan Grisham extended the order over the weekend for at least three more days upon a request from Gallup's mayor. #OperationGridlock #PowerToThePeople",
