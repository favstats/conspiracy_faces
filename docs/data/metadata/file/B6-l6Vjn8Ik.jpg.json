    "description": "Although measles deaths worldwide have fallen sharply since the 1960s, the World Health Organization has warned of a comeback around the world since 2017.\n\nSamoa's low vaccination rates are in part due to the deaths in 2018 of two children given a wrongly mixed vaccine.\n\nIn July 2018, two infants died in Samoa after receiving vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella, raising local fears over the vaccine itself.\n\nBut the deaths were later established to have been due to the nurses mixing the vaccine with an expired muscle relaxant, instead of water. The two nurses pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to five years in prison.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#parentalrights #vaccinationchoice #medicalfreedom #betweenmeandmydoctor #dothereasearch #medicalfreedomofchoice #protruth #vaccines #childrenshealth #doctorpatientrights #informedconsent #immunizations #medicalexemption #medicalrights #doctorsofcalifornia #californiadoctors #californiapidoctors",
