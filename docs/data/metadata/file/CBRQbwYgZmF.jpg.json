We call for the Immediate Resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cA lot of us are really disappointed,\u201d the petition continues. \u201cWe believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral. Without any investigation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus solely believes on [sic] the death and infected numbers that the Chinese government provided with them.\u201d \u2022\n#fauciisdeepstate #firefauci #exposebillgates\n#openourcountrynow #q #qarmy #wewillwin #thestorm #thegreatawakening #thebaqery #thestormisuponus #thestormishere #wakeup #maga #keepamericagreat #trump #trump2020 #freedom #wethepeople  #killgates #billgatesisevil#pedowood #pizzagate #spygate #thesepeoplearesick #thesepeoplearestupid #thesepeopleareevil",
