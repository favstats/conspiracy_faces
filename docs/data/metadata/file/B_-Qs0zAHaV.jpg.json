Quite frankly..I try to stay away from posting my views on things because they are not in line with all of the other \u201cinfluencers.\u201d (Yuck hate that word. \ud83e\udd74) Sorry if y\u2019all were here for another sell out that\u2019s trying to people please....I\u2019m not it. I will NEVER post a #stayhome photo. .\n.\nI have to be honest here...from the beginning of this thing, something deep down inside of me had a crazy uneasy feeling about what we were being told by the United States government. Now, let me also let you know that I tried SO DANG HARD to be positive, look at things with an open mind, & see both sides.\n.\n.\nWell, I\u2019m siding with basic logic & common sense. There are only so many freedoms I will allow to be ripped away from me and my family. How far will you allow them to push before they\u2019ve gone too far? #wakeupamerica .\n.\nLet\u2019s make waves, listen to your natural instincts. Let\u2019s end the stigma today that is around thinking for yourself. CREATE YOUR OWN POST & tag me for a shoutout! \u2665\ufe0f *post inspired by @informedmothers .\n.\n\ud83d\uded1 IMPORTANT MESSAGE: Let me go ahead and address this in the caption so I don\u2019t have to retype over & over! \ud83d\ude48 This post is NOT intended to say Covid19 is not real, it is very real. Sending out prayers to anyone directly effected. This post is about certain people in the United States government trying to overstep. \ud83d\udc97",
