    "description": "This was heavy on my heart today. Once you understand what is happening to children in this nation and around the world you will never be the same. Once you know you can never look away. Once you know you will never vote the same way again. You will begin to question everything. And if you are a parent you will always be on guard. Is this information hard to process? Yes. Is this information essential to know? Yes. Will you knowing about it make a difference? Yes, I believe it will. \nBecause if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, then how can you help them? If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know then how you protect your own kids from things that are slammed in their face daily from this sick industry? If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know then how can you be sure what your hard earned money is funding or who you are electing to office? \nEvery time I hear someone say.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just too dark.... I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know about it... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 it  makes me so angry because guess what? \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our responsibility to know what is happening in our country. The least we can do for these kids is to understand and acknowledge what is happening to them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our responsibility to help protect all children whether they are our own or not. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient or not\u00e2\u20ac\u201d-it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our job to protect children, period. \nWhether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycotting a brand, or a celebrity, or politician, or anything that condones, encourages the abuse of children, or funds these practices is something  we all need to be aware of. \nThere have been more human trafficking arrests and children saved recently and under the Trump administration then any other administration in our history. As a Nation we are AT WAR with these Cartels. Whether you choose to look or not it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still happening. There are a million issues happening at once right now, but I believe this is the thread that ties them all together. The money that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involved, the high powered elites that are involved, and the continued silence of themedia regarding this issue are all things that directly affect your life. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if your far left or right or somewhere in the middle this issue should bother you. Pharma, Politics, Hollywood, Schools and our Justice System is involved in this mess. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to start caring",
