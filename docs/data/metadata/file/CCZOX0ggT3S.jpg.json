    "description": "This was taken on Jan 2nd of this year. An hour prior to this, I had just let slip to @namof my long concealed obsessive interest (and alarm) in pandemics. People who knew or cared about the high impending probability of pandemics (more likely than any natural disaster within our lifetime to catastrophically affect our world) were generally considered to be just a weird nerdy crazy bunch so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned to not bring up the topic. Whelp, now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in it together aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we? \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u201c My friends and I joke now that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very exciting for me to finally not have to hide my fervor- but honestly, it has felt somehow worse. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fun watching the world learn facts that have BEEN out there for decades. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fun watching our health and social systems struggle and fail and the government not support our people when the warnings have been everywhere. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fun watching fear, ignorance, and politics win over properly actionable solutions. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fun watching our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complete lack of humility and inability to LEARN. We still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learned. We still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still dying. \n.\n.\nTo all the #MyBodyMyChoice #NoMasks #FreeCountry #NoMasksNeeded #Covid19Hoax #NoNewNormal #Plandemic #ExposeBillGates people: You are murderers. You are racists. You are a virus. You should die in place of everyone else that has suffered in this unnecessarily extended nightmare because of YOU.\n.\n.\n#WEARAFUCKINGMASK #HAVESOMESELFCONTROL #DONTBEASELFISHFUCK",
