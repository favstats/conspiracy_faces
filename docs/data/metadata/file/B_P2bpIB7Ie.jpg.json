    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nOn Monday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cThe View,\u201d co-host Joy Behar declared that armed lockdown protestors were \u201cterrorists\u201d. Behar said: \u201cWell, you know, let me first say that we are lucky to be working from home, all of us. I feel for these people who are losing their jobs. I really do. But they have to understand that they can infect other people. You know to paraphrase Patrick Henry, give me liberty and give me death is what they are basically proposing because a lot of people are going to die because of this behavior. It has already been shown that self-quarantining, whatever you want to call it, besides distancing and PPE\u2019s, has been working. It works.\u201d \u201cI was looking up #Sweden, one of my favorite countries, well they really screwed up. They have had this policy where everyone can go out and do what they have to do and use your own judgment don\u2019t gather in groups more than fifty people, which is a lot of people, by the way. They have closed the schools, yes they have, but people are going to restaurants. Now they have 17 times the rate of their fellow Scandinavian countries, Norway, Finland, etc. So it has not worked. It doesn\u2019t work. Stay home,\u201d she continued. \u201cThese people are being egged on by right-wing media and people like Alex Jones, like Rush Limbaugh. Why are you bringing guns to a rally?  You want to call yourself protesters leave your guns home. Those are terrorists that bring guns to rallies. I don\u2019t trust that at all. Don\u2019t listen to these people.\u201d #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #PsyOp #OperationGridlock #Coronavirus #CoViD19",
