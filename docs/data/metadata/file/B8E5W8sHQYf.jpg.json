It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all apart of the Rockefeller school system design to lie about the true history of the Amerikkka and maintain white superiority! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not your fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lies they fed us and continue to feed our children. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even teach about slavery anymore because they want the new generation to feel like Amerikkka doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a dark past and all the whites were superheroes in history! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not trying to cause division, because at the end of the day I still love everyone! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m making you think!  #hollyweirdisevil",
