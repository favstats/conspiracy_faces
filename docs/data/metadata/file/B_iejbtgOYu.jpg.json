The narrative. \ud83d\udcf1\u2063\n\u2063\nThere is NOTHING wrong with unfollowing, taking a break, \u201cseeing less of\u201d, leaving groups, or muting. Three things:\u2063\n\u2063\n1) placing boundaries is an act of love for both the other person AND yourself \u2063\n\u2063\n2) it isn\u2019t personal. Do what\u2019s best for you. In this current season. As you need it. Whether it\u2019s for business, personal, health, WHATEVER. \u2063\n\u2063\n3) YOUR WORTH IS NOT IN WHAT YOU DO, are a part of, your friends list and your following. \u2063\n\u2063\nWith the Limited time we all have in the day, and even more limited time that we are on social media, do yourself a favor, and don\u2019t be afraid to do these things. You can change your narrative at any time \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83e\udd1c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1c\ud83c\udffb. you are LOVED and worthy just as you are \ud83c\udf3b\u2063\n\u2063\n\n#valorup\u2063\n#takecourage\u2063\n#ownyournarrative\n#hippiemama",
