And to love, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to love \nWhy dwell so far \nCan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you hear me calling\nYour name is part of me now \ndistance is a foreign game \nCome let me undress you \nCome stark naked before the light of the sun\nFor nothing can hide here \nI bare witness to ignoble secrets buried \nThe decaying cage of decadence \nAnd the ones who thought lies could live \nBut the truth will out, the rest will wither\nDo I sense a voracious need \nTo be told\nIt is your time \nYour.time.to.be.free\nAnd answer, simply, to no one \nCome Dream With Me\nWhat else for us to do whilst the rest of the world natters away \nWe are not like them \nRemember \nWe could never fit in \nBecause it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late \nOnce everything is revealed \nThere is no going back \nThis is an ode to the old you that died \nWhat a great sacrifice \nYou are a grande spectacle now\nA thousand flames had burnt you \nBurnt away every last complaint \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late \nIt will never be the same...\nI took mercy and slowly undid your shackles whilst you were sleeping \nI hope you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind\n\nForever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m yours \nOh Great Mystery \u00f0\u0178\u0152\u00b9\n\nWhispers from a survivor of the natural world",
