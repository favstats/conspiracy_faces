    "description": "REPOST: @educatingliberals\nI thought this was an important video to make because of how many people were ready to give up on Q if mass arrests weren't made by Easter. Q has never mentioned a date for arrests & I think it's critical that people understand the difference between Q's actual drops & the theories that are made by anons. \nThe Swamp runs deeper than anybody can imagine - & draining it takes TIME combined with military precision. What is the point of making arrests if these traitors won't be held accountable in the court of law? This is the largest mass treason event in the history of our Country & we need to do this right.\n\nWe need to be easy on each other & work with one another from a place of love, patience, & understanding. None of this is easy & it's going to take all of us working together to achieve victory. So take care of yourselves, stay blessed in God, & keep fighting to spread the truth!\n\nAnd if anybody else would like to support my efforts in becoming a full-time citizen journalist, you can do so at Patreon.com/E4L - books & stickers will be sent out at the end of the month.
