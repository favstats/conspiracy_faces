Bring that shyt to 125st at least. @tamikadmallory @mysonnenygeneral You\u2019re downtown chanting \u201cthese are our streets\u201d. Nooooo! You\u2019re supposed to say that in the streets that are Being taken from yoouuuu. You remember how you protest everywhere a person loses their life to the cops?? You\u2019re supposed to gather up there at that spot. When Junior (God Bless) was killed. They didn\u2019t march downtown for him. They did it right there in the community. But you know. More publicity. Blah. Blah. Blah. Fraudulent marches. #AllLivesMatter  Y\u2019all done. The People are waking up, while y\u2019all still sleeping. It\u2019s sad you don\u2019t get the same crowd for the racial tension marches. That should tell you something. A lot of the people there get paid By #GeorgeSoros to cause that tension. He don\u2019t care when we kill us. He can\u2019t manipulated that for his agenda. Wake up! #Trump2020 #wwg1wga #BLM is Fake as Fcuk! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
