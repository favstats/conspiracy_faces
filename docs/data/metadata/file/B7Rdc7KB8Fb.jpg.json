    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nIf your new home isn\u2019t #carbonneutral, an #ElizabethWarren presidency might not let you build it. And if that means no new homes get built in the #UnitedStates, the #Massachusetts senator and Democrat presidential nominee says she\u2019s fine with that.\n\nIs this crop of Democrat presidential nominees deliberately trying to lose the 2020 election?\n\nIn October, Warren unveiled her plan to address \u201c#environmentalracism\u201d and \u201c#environmentalinjustice\u201d, by announcing a $1 trillion payout for \u201cminority communities\u201d affected by pollution and #climatechange.\n\nWarren\u2019s new plan to ban non carbon neutral houses is a step even further in the direction of far-left Crazytown.\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday, the Massachusetts senator and Democrat presidential candidate talked about her Thunberg-lite plan to help end climate change \u2014 and destroy the United States\u2019 economy in the process.\n\nWesternJournal report: During her appearance Warren was asked what she\u2019d do to \u201cchange the tide of U.S. policy on the issue of climate change\u201d and acted as if she\u2019d been thrown the softball of all softballs.\n\nShe promised \u201cto do everything a president can do all by herself, that is, the things you don\u2019t have to do by going to #Congress.\u201d This includes putting an end to energy mining and drilling on federal lands or offshore and \u201cnot having a coal lobbyist as head of the #EnvironmentalProtectionAgency.\u201d You might not be surprised to learn that\u2019s a dig at Andrew Wheeler, #PresidentDonaldTrump\u2019s EPA administrator, who was previously an attorney representing a coal producer.\n\nElizabeth Warren then moved on to her plan for housing, which she said was borne out of the dire predictions scientists have been making. \u201cWhat scares me is every time you go back to the scientists, they tell you two things,\u201d the senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than we thought, and we have less time. \u201cThat means we\u2019ve got to be willing to do things, for example, like regulation. By 2028, no new buildings, no new houses, without a zero carbon footprint.\u201d And she\u2019s coming for your car and electricity bill, too. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Agenda2050 #GreenNewDeal #SustainableDwve",
