    "description": "More left-wing journalists are waking up to the fact that unaccountable #SiliconValley corporations are ranking #Americans with a system that bears a growing resemblance to #China\u2019s #totalitarian \u201c#socialcredit\u201d system \u2014 almost a year after Breitbart Tech pointed out the same thing.\n\nChina\u2019s \u201csocial credit\u201d system assigns citizens with a \u201cscore\u201d based on good or bad behavior, which is in part determined by one\u2019s compliance with #Beijing\u2019s totalitarian communist value system. Those who fall below a certain score are excluded from basic services. There\u2019s no escape, either; to track everyone\u2019s behavior, China subjects its citizens to mass surveillance, powered by a network of facial recognition cameras all across the country. Chinese citizens literally can\u2019t escape their #socialcreditscore \u2014 low scores blocked 23 million Chinese citizens from traveling via train or airplane in less than one year, as reported by the Guardian.\n\nIn an article for Engadget, left-wing writer Violet Blue notes that big tech companies have developed a system that is remarkably similar to China\u2019s, ranking the behavior of users \u2014 and arbitrarily kicking them off their services \u2014 according to Silicon Valley\u2019s own set of subjective values, including what it considers to be \u201cconscientious\u201d and \u201copen\u201d behavior. She takes particular aim at Airbnb:\n\nThe Evening Standard reported on Airbnb\u2019s patent for AI that crawls and scrapes everything it can find on you, \u201cincluding social media for traits such as \u2018conscientiousness and openness\u2019 against the usual credit and identity checks and what it describes as \u2018secure third-party databases\u2019.\u201d Blue makes the connection to China, where similarly invasive surveillance is used to build a profile and a social credit score on every citizen:\n\nThe most famous #socialcreditsystem in operation is that used by China\u2019s government. It \u201cmonitors millions of individuals\u2019 behavior (including social media and online shopping), determines how moral or immoral it is, and raises or lowers their \u201ccitizen score\u201d accordingly,\u201d reported Atlantic in 2018. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Technocracy #SurveillanceState #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast",
