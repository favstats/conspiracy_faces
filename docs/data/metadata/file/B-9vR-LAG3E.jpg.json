    "description": "Responding to a Howard Stern joke about reptilians, Corgan became serious and said, \u201cNot to add to the conspiracy, but I\u2019ve had paranormal experiences in my life that sort of lend itself into that category.\u201d Sounding surprised, Howard Stern encouraged Corgan to open up about the experience. \u201cI\u2019m turning red I\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d said Corgan, before explaining, \u201cLet\u2019s just say I was with somebody once, and I saw a transformation I can\u2019t explain.\u201d Howard asked, \u201cThe person transformed into something other than human?\u201d Corgan responded, \u201cYes, I saw it. I was totally sober. Imagine you\u2019re doing something, and suddenly you turn around, and there\u2019s somebody else standing there. It\u2019s hard to explain without going into detail, I\u2019d rather not do it.\u201d Corgan said he wasn\u2019t hallucinating or imagining the incident. When he asked the shapeshifting humanoid-reptilian what had happened, the entity acknowledged what had happened.\n\nHoward asked, \u201cWhat did they say they were, from another planet?\u201d Corgan responded, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t explain. It\u2019s a really messed up story. I\u2019m being vague on purpose. It\u2019s up there with one of the most intense things I\u2019ve ever been through.\u201d The Smashing Pumpkins frontman later explained that he was being vague on air out of fear for his career and the wellbeing of his loved ones. \u201cDemons exist. They are real. They are reptilian. That\u2019s why the Bible says Eve was seduced by a snake. Substitute reptile for snake,\u201d Corgan said, before elaborating about his experience with the record industry-Illuminati.\n\nDescribing the record industry executive who shapeshifted in front of him during a meeting, Corgan said that he \u201ccan\u2019t remember the exact words\u201d the reptilian said to him, \u201cbut it was something along the lines of: All humans will suffer in unending agony.\u201d\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f",
