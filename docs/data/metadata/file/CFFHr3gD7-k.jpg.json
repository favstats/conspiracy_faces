Being mad about things going on didn\u2019t stop you from reading a book, learning how to eat right, building and improving important relationships, learning a new skill or even simply going for a walk\n\nIf anything, 2020 has given most of us more time to do these very things and just like the guy who always says \u201cdiet starts Monday\u201d many of you are in the same, if not worse place right now than you\u2019d been if you just done a little bit\n\nSo, I know how I\u2019m going to use these last 109 days...\n\nThe same way I\u2019ve used everyone before it\n\nOn improving myself\n\nYou in?\n\n#2020\n#alwaysimproving\n#dietstartsmonday\n#startnow\n#nonewnormal\n#noinviteneeded\n#75hard\n#teamrowanfitness",
