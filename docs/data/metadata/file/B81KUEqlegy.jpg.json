    "description": "This is me breaking down. Yea I was hysterical crying on the phone with my husband telling him I can\u2019t deal with this anymore. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat am I talking about?\u2063\n\u2063\nI get labeled a lot. And I get judged and unfollowed people that are important to me (or so ai thought). I get pinpointed in reposting of hurtful articles and it weighs heavy in my heart.\u2063\n\u2063\nI have lost friends and dynamics of family members have changed because of judgment. \u2063\n\u2063\nI\u2019m not posting this for anyone to feel bad. I\u2019m posting this because something has to fucking change. \u2063\n\u2063\nEarlier last year the state of Florida was proposing mandated vaccines for all children (and eventually adults) without regard to predisposed issues. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo, I did something brave, and became vocal. It\u2019s not the governments place to take away medical rights. I don\u2019t care if you vaccinate or not. \u2063\n\u2063\nI did something that put me in a position of hateful opinions and severance of relationships (not on my end). I started to share my truth and my decisions. This was because I broke down ingredient by ingredient what was in vaccines today (which is very different from when I was even a kid). And I did this because I watched my second child suffer. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy point in this post is that it\u2019s never OK to emotionally judge or label someone. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s wrong with our society and this generation. We all feel that it\u2019s our way or the highway and the fact of the matter is that life is beautiful with so many choices and it\u2019s not black-and-white. \u2063\n\u2063\nI will never shame, or judge anyone for their choices as long as they\u2019re doing it for the betterment of themselves or family. If you don\u2019t agree that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m in no way shape or form telling you your wrong. What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s just not right for us... and that has nothing to do with you. So why does that trigger you?\u2063\n\u2063\nI\u2019m sick of feeling like an outcast. I\u2019m sick of feeling different. I\u2019m sick of feeling labeled and judged. This is very heavy for me. It makes me want to seclude and recluse. It\u2019s lonely and dark. But, I\u2019m just sharing my truth... and honesty is what you\u2019ll get here. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#medicalfreedom #floridafreedomfighter #medicalrights #humanrightsactivist",
