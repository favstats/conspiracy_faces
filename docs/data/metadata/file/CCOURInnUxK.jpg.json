    "description": "Happy 4th of You Lie!! For the record I am not homophobic or transphobic. I am bi. \nI have gay friends and gay family members.\nI am not active in being with a woman.\nI just like what I like. Anytime you bring up these things folks get uncomfortable. \nI actually watch this series with my man. We have been watching it since the very first season. \nI wasn't aware this was the reason why they killed his character off the series. Is this true? Sorry to this man. \nBut if any producer is paying me good money and they write a script for me to do anything that compromise my values or beliefs etc. I won't agree to it. Even if they say \"\"Hey April make love to this evil ugly ass man on the show. \"\" And guess what? I would not agree to it if I didn't feel up to it. I won't do it and just kill me off the show or however you want to write me off. \nEveryone isn't the same. Honor people where they are. Don't force shit. *Update* to clarify he just \"\"might\"\" get a new script to return back this season or in the future .\n#thechi\n#4thofyoulie \n#problack\n#facts \n#divinemasculine\n#mood \n#thinkaboutit \n#standforsomethingorfallforanything\n#hollyweirdisevil\n#freethinking",
