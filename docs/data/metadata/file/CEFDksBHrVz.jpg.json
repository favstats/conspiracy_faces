    "description": "Help me wish a happy heavenly \u2601\ufe0f birthday to this sweet little soul, Evee! Today she should be spending her 2nd birthday wrapped up her mamas arms. \n\nUnfortunately, Evee never got the chance to celebrate a single birthday. Her mother is empty handed today... left with only pictures and far too few memories of her sweet little girl. \n\nEvee is one of MANY children who\u2019s life was cut short due to vaccination, but her soul lives on and saves lives every single day. Happy Birthday Evee!\n@justiceforevee \n#healthybabiesdontjustdie\n #readtheinsert\n #justiceforevee",
