Or are you wearing a face mask because you are scared of a fine, which goes against Australian federal law (and people who are challenging the fines are getting them nullified)? Or are you wearing a mask because you just want to fit in and are scared of being confronted by an aggressive mask-wearer (who probably doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to wear a mask either)?\n\nWe know it can be intimidating to go mask-free but taking a stand for your personal rights and freedom is also very liberating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity to find out what you are really made of: courage or fear?\n#repost @friendsoftruth\n#freeface #maskoff #journeybacktoface #masks #facemask #endthelockdown #freemelbourne #freevictoria #regrann #nonewnormal #saynotobillgates #event201 #id2020 #backtoschool #bigmike",
