There are many representatives of Flat Earth but you do not have to agree with everything. The FE model chosen does not function in a heliocentric system, so it does not fly, it does not hang in space as it is presented and compares to a rotating earth, but it is believed that it is in the center and everything that we observe the movement of the sun, moon, stars takes place over stationary earth (continents surrounded by oceans). so edge edge questions may not be needed. Some people think that Mark is not honest in everything he says, it is important to talk about it, it is obvious that the media is controlled and may release false information to try to discredit the FE. So don't believe, just research.\"\"\"\"\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \n#flatearthers #thismorning #marksargent #youtubecensorship #theyhaveyoubytheballs #censorship #flatearthexperiment #experiment #joiningdots #governmentlies #elitelies #earthisflat #earthisnotaglobe #earthisarealm #earthisnotaspinningball #nasalies #openyoureyes #openyourmind #trustyoursenses #researchthetruth @researchflatearth_ #researchflatearth",
