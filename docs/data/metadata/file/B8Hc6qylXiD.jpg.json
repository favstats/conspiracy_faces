    "description": "God was a yeller, or so #KathyIreland thought.\nAt the #church she grew up in, the pastor preached a screechy, judgmental message and she superimposed the image of her pastor on #God. She thought that God must be like that.\n\u201cThere was a part of me that was kind of scared of God,\u201d Ireland says on an I am Second video. \u201cThe church that I attended as a child, the leader there would kind of yell.\u201d\nShe jumped into modeling at age 16 and was featured in #Vogue, #Cosmopolitan, #Forbes, #Mademoiselle and the racy #SportsIllustrated swimsuit edition multiple times.\nIreland flew off to Paris to start modeling at age 18. \u201cIt sounds so much more glamorous than it was,\u201d she admits.\nHer mother, who had accepted Jesus when Ireland was a teen, slipped a #Bible in her luggage. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable staying at a home provided in #Paris. She often locked herself in her room, and other models who stayed there ominously called it \u201cthe dungeon.\u201d\nOne night, lonely, bored, jet-lagged, Ireland found the Bible and began to thumb through its pages, a novelty for her.\n\u201cI randomly opened up to the #Gospel of Matthew,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cAs I read, my life was forever changed.\u201d\nIreland had been a rebellious teenager who questioned authority.

He wasn\u2019t yelling. Instead, He was loving, and He was leading.\u201d\nIreland discovered that #modeling is a world flush with #exploitation. \u201cParticularly as a young woman out in the world for the first time, in a world that often times felt dominated by men of questionable character, it gave me such #comfort to know that Jesus loves women and honors them,\u201d she says.\nJesus became Ireland\u2019s #Lord, #Savior and best friend.\nShe now says that she remained a \u201cbaby #Christian\u201d for a very long time \u2014 and she regrets it.\n\u201cI would continue to read the word,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cBut I would just read the same verses over and over.\u201d\nThere were other verses that she would come across that she \ud83d\udc47",
