    "description": "This was on the front of the Washington post that our neighboring county just literally down the road, a state road, is going to be banning masks there at the office for deputies and for visitors. You actually can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go inside with them on. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to wait outside. How do you feel about this? I appreciate any and all opinions. He talks about the science and his feelings on it. I fully support those who choose to wear a mask. I understand many are mandated to do so where they live. Some are not. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique where we live because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandated in one city, but not the next one which we live on the border, and the county has no mandate and the state has no mandate. How about where you live? #HealthNutNews #Mask #HolisticHealth #NaturalHealth #HealthFreedom #MedicalChoice #MedicalFreedom #ExposeBillGates",
