    "description": "I tell people all the time to watch what you say because life and death is in the tongue. You saw this before with Tupac. His family and friends would constantly say that he said he was going to die and he talked about it all the time in his songs. You saw it also with Michael Jackson. He was always telling people that he was going to die, especially his sister Toya. He was telling her that for years. And especially these rappers nowadays! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all they talk about is death and suicide. Especially NBA Youngboy and Billie Eilish. Rapper Juicewrld said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wanna live past 21 and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. So be careful what you speak over you life and anyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because you could be cursing yourself. I love you guys\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00af #hollyweirdisevil #kobebryant",
