WE HAVE NEVER SEEN EQUALITY IN MEDICINAL FIELD.\nOUR MONEY IS GREEN BUT AS LONG AS OUR BODIES ARE MELANIN THEY DONT SEE US AS PEOPLE. \nThe 63-year-old spent weeks on the front lines working at Beaumont Hospital, which is in a suburb of Detroit. She fell sick with a cough and fever before going to the ER on March 16. But when Gatewood visited the hospital, she was given cough syrup and told to rest at home. They sent her home saying you are showing signs of COVID. So they were confirming that she most likely had COVID, but they did not test her. The fact that she got infected by doing the job she did for 31 years and she couldn't get taken care of by her own family, Gatewood went back to the ER three more times, and each time the hospital told her to rest at home despite her rising fever and worsening condition\nWe need our own doctors, nurses and scientist.
