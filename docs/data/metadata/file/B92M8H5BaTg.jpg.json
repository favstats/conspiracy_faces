    "description": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the cash relief in an early Tuesday internal company notice, adding that he wants to support employees working from home due to the pandemic, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nAs we reported yesterday, a government plan to give each #American adult $1,000 has been picking up steam after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) endorsed the idea on Monday. Sen. Tom Cotton also says he's working on legislation that would include cash stipends for #Americans affected by the outbreak.\n\nMeanwhile in #Chicago, restaurant workers, delivery drivers and other low-wage employees who receive tips can now access emergency cash if they are affected by the pandemic, according to CBS2 Chicago.\n\nThe One Fair Wage campaign has launched an emergency cash relief fund and is offering $213 in cash for any tipped worker affected after some states including #Illinois temporarily shut down bars and restaurants to stop the spread of the virus. The organization is also seeking donations to help fund the effort. -CBS2 Chicago \"\"\"\"This global health crisis for all of us is also an acute economic crisis for tipped workers and service workers,\"\"\"\" said co-founder of One Fair Wage, Saru Jayaraman. \"\"\"\"These are the workers who have trouble making ends meet in good times. In hard times like this, they need our help. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping to raise as much money as possible to give as many workers as possible cash assistance of $213.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"We chose that amount as a nod to the horrific $2.13 federal sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.\"\"\"\" Illinois bars and restaurants were closed on Monday following an announcement from Gov. JB Pritzker. While the closure is scheduled to last through March 30, Pritzker said the state was looking for solutions to keep restaurant kitchens open in order to provide food delivery to people's homes. Meanwhile, drive-through and curbside pickup are still available. #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #UniversalBasicIncome",
