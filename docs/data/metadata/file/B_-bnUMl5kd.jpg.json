    "description": "Last night we had a late frost... our frost free date is supposed to be April 15... so we covered our berries and a few other plants and today I\u2019m wearing jeans and a jacket! Sometimes life is a little unpredictable! .\n.\nBut yesterday was the twins 5th birthday, we had a great party last night... today we are putting in the rest of our garden plants (luckily missed the last late frost!) and are enjoying each day as we lull towards summer. (the kids are asking to put up an inflatable pool. it\u2019s 60 degrees. \ud83e\uddd0\ud83d\ude02) .\n.\nWe love this family time but we are excited so many places are opening back up, and we can\u2019t wait for summer and hopefully no more talk of the CV and a huge harvest in the garden.\n.\n.\nHow have your last few days been? What are you up to today?? HUGS! \ud83d\udc9b\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#homesteading #farmhouse #latefrost #gardening #twinmom #momlife #farmlife #openamerica #freedom #farm #garden #thefarmhousemovement #growthings",
