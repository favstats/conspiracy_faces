    "description": "Sweden was nearly the only country who stuck to modern science, versus regressing to medieval superstition.\n\nAnd now they get the reward - back to the old normal, freedom, democracy, civil rights and a great society.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting there were almost no Covid deaths in Sweden in August and so far in September none. Only 16 ICU beds are currently in use for Covid, and this is in a country with a population of 10 million.\n\nThe medical system in the US is run by the pharmaceutical industry. There are pills for every problem. This is the reason there is so much obesity and illness in the US, people do not take any personal responsibility for their health. Thus they are anxiously waiting for the magic bullet vaccine that will supposedly solve all their problems. But it will not give them democracy, the one thing needed. They will continue to be ruled by big Pharma, no matter who they vote for.",
