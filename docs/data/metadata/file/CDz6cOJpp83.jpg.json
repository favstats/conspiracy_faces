Because most Americans agree that criminals who steal the innocence of children are among the worst of the worst, Alabama has decided to pass a chemical castration bill that would forever change any person convicted of an abhorrent sex crime against a child under the age of thirteen, which is a measure approved by most people across the state.State Representative Steve Hurst, a Republican, introduced the bill. It was passed by the state legislature and was recently signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey. Because the state wants to make it abundantly clear that child molesters are not welcome, the law now requires that any child sex offenders over the age of 21 will be chemically castrated before they leave prison and entered society again.\n\u201cThey have marked this child for life, and the punishment should fit the crime,\u201d Hurst said.\nThe Republican hopes that this drastic punishment will make a would-be child molester think twice before committing such a heinous crime against the youth of the state.\n\nRepost from @anne.bonny_\n\u2022\n\nhttps://crime.awm.com/one-state-just-passed-a-law-to-castrate-child-sex-offenders-2-2-2-2-3/\n.\n\nSAVE THE CHILDREN\n.\nWe need more voices.\n.\nFollow: @Qforce__\nSupport the Q-Munity & help SAVE THE CHILDREN.\n.\nWWG1WGA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n#Q #Qanon #DarkToLight  #SheepNoMore #TheGreatAwakening #DigitalArmy #WWG1WGA #memeWAR #Trump #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #DrainTheSwamp #deplorable #weareQ #pizzagate #pedowood #ChildTrafficking #ChildAbuse #SexTrafficking #DisneyIsEvil \n#endracism \n#moreconpassion \n#equalrights \n#blacklivesmatter \n#childlivesmatter\n#satanicritualabuse",
