    "description": "Right now Big Tech is trying to Bankrupt America.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nThey are pushing and selling fear across all of their outlets to their benefit. They pretend like they are there to help the small everyday person survive by offering X amount in FREE Facebook and Google advertising... However that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nThey want this lockdown to continue as long as possible, the longer it goes the more traditional businesses go under and the more people will be forced to adapt to the new way of business which is based on their platform exclusively.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nThe issue there is that they continuously increase the costs to advertise and overtime you compete with Jeff Bezos and not Joe the Plumber... it\u2019s a tough battle to win.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nIn addition Facebook to this they are using \u201cSocial Distancing\u201d as a way to reduce their everyday office employees (45,000 of them) to work from home, meaning they will begin outsourcing their talent to being in a more diverse outlook AKA hire from overseas.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nJack Dorsey and Google will follow and we will see  tens of TRILLIONS in salaries leave America and flood to other countries in the coming years.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nLink in Bio for the full video.",
