    "description": "I know all of these women personally. This is not fake news. This is called a revolution. This is not about a virus. This is about control, manipulation, and stealing our rights. When the First Amendment is no longer protected what will come next? One day we will all look back at this time in history and see which side we stood on. The side of fear and manipulation or the side of truth, justice and freedom for all. I am proud to know these women and I am proud to call them my friends. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to be brave America. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to start asking tough questions. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to pay attention to everything. *Reposted image from @theinformedmama209 \n#UnitedWeStand \n#FreedomFighters",
