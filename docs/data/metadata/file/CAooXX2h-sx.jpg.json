    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nFormer #British Prime Minister #TonyBlair has questioned #PresidentTrump\u2019s leadership during the #coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBlair\u2019s idea\u2019s echoe those of another former UK PM, Gordon Brown, who recently urged world leaders to create a temporary form of #globalgovernment to tackle the crisis caused by the coronavirus.\n\nBeing concerned about what he called \u201cthe absence of global coordination\u201d, Blair harked back to his work alongside, #GeorgeBush (his partner in war crimes), #BillClinton and #BarackObama, as being good examples of how global inter-governmental cooperation can work at winning the day.\n\nBreitbart reports: His remarks in an interview with NBC News last Friday followed an earlier intervention in the crisis when his own #globalist think tank claimed it is \u201cembedded in governments around the world,\u201d as Breitbart News reported.\n\nIn his most recent observations, he told NBC News he was worried about the lack of global coordination in tackling the crisis. \u201cThe worry I have that an absence of global coordination and global leadership that\u2019s necessary for it is a huge problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think back to the times when I\u2019m dealing with American presidents whether it\u2019s Bill Clinton or George Bush, Barack Obama as well, the most important thing at a time like this is to say, \u2018How do you bring the world together?\u201d By building more and bigger global government, Blair believes leaders could find a vaccine together, accelerate the development of therapeutics and testing capability, while keeping the international economy afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s that global coordination, the absence of which means that each individual country\u2019s less effective at dealing with the disease. That\u2019s the thing that worries me,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe left-wing former Labour leader was asked his opinion on Trump\u2019s suggestions on fighting the epidemic, he said: \u201cI think most people would understand what I would think, but it\u2019s probably better sometimes not to say it.\u201d Read More: [https://newspunch.com/tony-blair-calls-for-stronger-who-more-global-government-during-pandemic/] #VaccineAgenda #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
