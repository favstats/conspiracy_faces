    "description": "The frustration with IG will never go away...\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found over the past couple of years of participating in educating the general public about certain topics like nutrition, birth control, etc... that it is somewhat of a pointless battle\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nI would put a lot of time into answering questions on stories or DMs just to come to the realization that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sustainable to put out these resources because at the end of the day I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m competing against accounts that spread lies for money. Any account that creates content and fear about one or two topics has endless energy to do so. I do not rely on IG for my well-being and thus I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m spread thin.\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nNot having a tangible product like a book about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpost birth control syndrome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (not a real thing) or a supplement is a real detriment. Educating to educate does reach true burnout while trying to compete for attention on IG.\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned to stay away from arguing about these topics because non-science believers are going to continue to follow fear-mongerers because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient for them..it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient to blame their weight gain, their depression, their inability to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget the body they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve wanted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on one thing.\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to continue to unfollow accounts that continue to endorse non-scientific posts even if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just reposting on stories.\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\nKeep believing in opinion books and articles. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to the ER when you need a real scientific-based opinion.\n\u00e2\u2014\u00a6\n#postbirthcontrolsyndrome#bc#birthcontrolpills#birthcontrolproblems#fearmongering#supps#weightgain#healthylifestyle",
