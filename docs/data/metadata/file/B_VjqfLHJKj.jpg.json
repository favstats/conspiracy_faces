Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. Code names for drug-related experiments were Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke. - Wikipedia \n_______\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nFollow me \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u2030 @3rd_eye_control_it for daily content like this and More \nTag a friend below \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u00a5 \nShare/repost to your story -\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \n#truthseekers #nwo #conspiracyfact #freethinkers #4biddenknowledge #truthseeker #knowledgeispower #seekthetruth #freethinker #wakeupsheeple #staywoke #downtherabbithole #newworldorder #conspiracy #freeyourmind #knowledgeiskey #woke #wakeuppeople #truth #freedomthinker #freedomthinkers #knowledge #questioneverything #chemtrails #geoengineering #mindcontrol #thinkforyourself #mkultra #mkultraexposed #conspiracytheory",
