    "description": "I'm about truth... I use a cleaner to cleanse my body all the time. I use colloidal silver in my nose and throat to clean out microbes. It\u2019s my disinfectant of choice. \nAny of you ever gargle hydrogen peroxide or pour it on a wound? Well guess what, you have done exactly what Trump suggested. You used a disinfectant in and on your body. \nRepost \nFor the record, Trump was asking the doctors and theorising, spitballing... Earlier in the briefing, Dr. Bill Bryant, leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light, warmer temperatures, and more humid conditions. He added that disinfectants had also been effective against it.\n\nTrump, responding to that, noted that there had been discussions of testing ultraviolet light on patients, or of methods to bring light inside the body. \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it [the virus] out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning, cause you see it gets in the lungs.\u201d At no time did Trump actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant; he deferred to \u201cmedical doctors\u201d to figure out how to apply Dr. Bryant\u2019s research.\n\n#FAKENEWS #IDONOTCONSENT\n#NoNewNormal #SayNoToBillGates",
