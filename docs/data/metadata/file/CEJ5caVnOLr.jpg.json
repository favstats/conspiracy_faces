    "description": "Watch this highly informative video by fellow physician Dr. Carrie Madej, explaining the 3 major components of the Moderna vaccine and the implications. This is a must view video. If this video doesn't open the eyes of those who don't get it, who I refer to affectionately as \"\"sheeple\"\", nothing will!\n\nI've previously brought up how if we allow the mandatory vaccination rhetoric to proceed, humans will no longer be human. And I've talked about Moderna and the implications of their RNA vaccine which has never been commercially produced before. But Dr. Madej does an outstanding job going into greater detail.  Watch this, and share it with everyone. \n\nBut Dr. Madej is wrong about one thing. She says it \"\"may\"\" cause genetic modification in our genome.  Remember, the function of RNA is to repair and re-write the DNA.  She's being overly generous with her words...it WILL cause a genetic change which will continue to re-write and \"\"repair\"\", ie, change our DNA. \n\ud83d\udd06\nIn addition, the PLANDemic full length movie came out yesterday.
