He left his vehicle and began running on foot. By the video it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear he was tased and hit the ground. A couple seconds later over 15 shots are fired and Sean was killed. This video is the end of his livestream, where an unidentied cop picks up the phone while hiding his face. Not only did he stop the recording but he deleted the video off Seans Facebook. He was clearly not aware many were screen recording the incident. I believe this took place In #indianapolis . The question is why was he shot so many times after being tased and already on the ground? Did he have a firearm? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the justification for these harsh actions? Care to fill us in @indianapolispolice ?  #fortworthtexas #fortworthtx #indianapolisindiana #indianapolispolice @impd_news \n#IMPD #seandadon #RIH #SeanReed  While the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\n#Coronachallege #coronamemes\n\nWatch as these gang members show their control over our communities. Using Violence, Aggressive, and Disrespectful words and behavior.\n\nThey are nothing more then bullies. Most of them are racist. Joining the police allows them the power they want over the people they hate. They get a license to kill and traumatizes our people. THE POLICE ARE THE BIGGEST ORGANIZED GANG.\n\nTHEY HAVE NEVER STOPPED MOVING AS SLAVE CATCHERS. \nI dont know if the answer is more BLACK cops especially when they hurt us worse. Just to prove they are one of the good ones to their white masters. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"fair use\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
