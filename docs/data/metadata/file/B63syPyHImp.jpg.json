    "description": "The world has waited over 2,500 years to see the headlines we are now seeing... Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, was killed this morning by a United States drone strike.\nIt's the beginning of the new year, and already the prophetic war of the ages, Ezekial 38-39 is in our sights. If you're unaware, God has set aside two whole chapters in the Bible to warn mankind of this coming war. God warns Iran (Persia), being fully directed, commanded, and controlled by Russia (Magog), along with a coalition of allies (including Turkey) WILL go to war and will attack and invade Israel. In Ezekial 38-39 this coming war with these nations will take place sometime AFTER Israel would be re-gathered into Her land as a nation, which occured May 14th 1948.\nThis war will be unlike any other war in history. It will change the world forever! It will unleash a series of events which will lead the world into the coming Apocalypse and Armageddon.\nPlease do not ignore Bible prophecies.\nEzekiel 38 & 39 in comments \u2b07\ufe0f #bible #prophecy #endtimes #ezekiel #war #iran #america #israel #trump #God #JesusChrist #YHWH #MostHigh #HeavenlyFather #letGodbetrue #everymanaliar #antichrist #beastsystem #markofthebeast #armageddon #apocalypse #rapture #thegreattribulation",
