It\u2019s one of the stupidest theories I have ever heard, but people seriously believe that the government and media are making all of this up and empty hospitals prove it. I don\u2019t even have the patience to explain how stupid this really is.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe healthcare system is hemorrhaging right now. They are hemorrhaging money, resources, and their most valuable assets: their employees. If we had a broken healthcare system before, consider what this is going to do to it. We are going to hurt for a long time after this, BUT we will continue as long as necessary because as healthcare workers, we know what is right and what needs to be done to control this.\u2063\n\u2063\nWomen are delivering babies alone, loved ones are sick with no visitors for support, healthcare workers are getting sick without enough protective equipment, and people are dying. \ud835\ude19\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is real and this is scary for us all.\u2063\nPlease stay home. Please take this seriously\u2063\n\u2063\nThank you to my dear friend @drjenniferlincoln for starting this conversation. I encourage you to share your own stories with the hashtag #thisisnotahoax and read the stories of the true frontliners who are terrified to go to work every day.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#coronavirus #covid19 #stayhome #stayathome #physicaldistancing #socialdistancing #healthcareworkers #frontline #protectourdoctors #ppe #hospitals #believescience #factsoverfear",
