    "description": "Throughout this entire pandemic hardly a day at work went by that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out for a walk, many days hardly seeing anyone. Businesses shut, streets without traffic. What felt like 6sm on a Sunday morning was what should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been the afternoon rush. It was oddly peaceful but eerily quite at the same time\n\nSo, to take a turn down a random city block and find it lined with tables and tents with people enjoying each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company for happy hour is a welcoming sight\n\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope it only gets better from here\n\n#nystrong\n#happyhour\n#downtownnyc\n#nycstreets\n#positivevibes\n#thursdaythoughts\n#dailywalks",
