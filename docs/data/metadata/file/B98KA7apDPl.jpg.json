It said he has also decided to change the norm regarding the crime of child pornography by making the possession and dissemination of pornographic images of children under the age of 18, no longer 14, fall under the category of delicta graviora - the most grave delicts.  This first decision means that any reporting, testimony and documents produced in canonical trials related to such cases of sexual abuse - those kept in Vatican Dicastery archives as well as those found in diocesan archives - which until now were subject to the pontifical secret, can now be handed over when requested to lawful authorities in their respective countries.  The pontifical secret in these cases has been scrapped by a 'Rescript' signed by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The Catholic Church's standing has been badly hit by a long series of child-sex-abuse scandals in many parts of the world.\nAny Thoughts with the on going cases of child sex trafficking? \u274c\nOriginal Video: @researchflatearth_ \nfollow: @eyewitness9 be inform \ud83d\udc41\n#pizzagate #pedogate #frazzledrip #pizzagateisreal #elitepedophiles #elitepedorings #jefferyepsteindidntkillhimself #hollywood #hollyweird #hollywoodspeaks #hollywoodisevil #hollyweirdisevil #wakeup #openyoureyes #illuminati #secretsocieties #secretsrevealed #batinanescafe #cabal #rabbithole #nwo #mkultra #mindcontrol #mkultramindcontrol #kabal #adrenochrome #sra #satanicritualabuse",
