    "description": "If there was ever a time to use your voice, it\u2019s NOW. Silence is compliance\n\nHave the courage to be disliked\nmisunderstood \ndifferent, and indifferent about it\n\nI have accepted the fact that I am always going to ruffle some feathers in others. Perhaps I am problematic and insensitive to some. I cannot control the narrative that others feel fitting - nor do I care to\n\nI refuse to stop questioning the world around me and stepping up to make it the best possible place to be. I will  never stop insinuating for you to do the same\n\nUnlike most, I can\u2019t accept this BS phrase \u201cit\u2019s just how it is\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s  unrealistic\u201d. I refuse to accept this ludicrous road map our generation has been conditioned to believe is the way, or even remotely fulfilling. Things are changing, there is no doubt about that - but are you doing your part?\n\nThis is the world my son is raised in, it is my responsibility as a mother to make sure he knows I did everything in my power to make his life on earth a beautiful one. Children are the light, the future, we are raising the next movers and shakers, but one undeniable truth about children, is that they lead by example\n\nI am not out here trying to carve a new path, I am planting an entirely new forest. The world I grew up in no longer exists, but the one we are building for our future generations will be better - how are you contributing? \u26a1\ufe0f",
