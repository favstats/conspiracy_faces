    "description": "Hi all - not sure if you remember me, but I originally started this page to document my curly journey. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122all are wondering what the heck happened to this page. Have I been hijacked? Lost my marbles? Probably. But since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started this journey I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve begun to learn so much more.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nI know I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t post the most popular opinions here. I know people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with me whatsoever. And I get it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely ok. I was that girl 6 months ago.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nI rolled my eyes and skipped past the people who talked about things I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with. I was you.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nBut slowly, slowly, slowly those seeds people had planted began to bloom. And I am so thankful for the people in my life who poured into me these past couple of months. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so thankful for the community of people I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so thankful for each and every one of you who have taken the time to send messages of support to me.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nI hope you all know that the things I share are from my heart. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share from a place of ridicule/blame/judgment but from a place of love. I hope that I can be a seed in your life too.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\nLove all of y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122all and thanks for sticking around to see me figure out life.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\n#lifejourney #curlyhairjourney #loveyourself #loveyourlife #kinkycurlycurlingcustard #ouidad #believemothers #neverstoplearning",
