Now he\u2019s holding a rally glorifying white supremacy at Mount Rushmore\u2013a region once sacred to tribal communities.\u201d\n\nThe linked story from the Guardian quotes Oglala Lakota tribe member Nick Tilsen, the president of local activist group \u201cNDN Collective,\u201d as calling Mount Rushmore a symbol of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy, of structural racism that\u2019s still alive and well in society today,\u201d Tilsen said, a message echoed by the Democrat Party\u2019s formal Twitter account.\n\nThe Guardian piece goes on to note that Tilsen wants to see Mount Rushmore torn down altogether.\n\nThe push from the Democrats to target Mount Rushmore comes as leftist activists tear down monuments and statues around the country. But the move by the Democrat Party to put the iconic American mountainside monument to four great American presidents\u2013George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln\u2013in the crosshairs by claiming it represents \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d when it clearly does not may go too far for some voters.\n\nSeveral on Twitter were quick to rip the Democrats for pushing attempts to destroy Mount Rushmore. \n\n#realnews #darktolight #wwg1wga\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #sheepnomore #wwg1wgaworldwide #thegreatawakening #qmap #q #thesepeoplearesick #mindcontrol #thesepeoplearestupid #painiscoming #operationmockingbird #pedogate #redpill #spiritcooking #hisnamewassethrich #whatisq #declass #wearethenewsnow #obamagate",
