The\u00c2\u00a0U.S. ranked\u00c2\u00a0last on performance overall and\u00c2\u00a0ranked\u00c2\u00a0last or near last on the Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and\u00c2\u00a0Health Care\u00c2\u00a0Outcomes domains. The top-ranked\u00c2\u00a0countries overall were the U.K., Australia, and the Netherlands.\nAs we come together as a world to defeat Corona virus I can't help but to express that we have a lot to learn from other developed countries that clearly have a better health care system than the U.S does.",
