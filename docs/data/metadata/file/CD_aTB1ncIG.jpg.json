NO, THATS NOT ACCURATE \u2063\n\u2063\nFollow @antidiet_dietitian \ud83d\udc9c\u2063\n\u2063\nNowaydays we hear about \"\"Anti-inflammatory diets\"\" & so many people blaming and putting milk/dairy in the pro inflammatory category... \u2063\n\u2063\nFor many, milk comes to mind as something to eliminate but HOLD it THERE! \u2063\n\u2063\nIt has been proven over and over, that milk has actually anti inflammatory effects on health markers, and there is still so much emerging evidence coming our way!!!\n\u2063\nWhy would you want to eliminate an anti-inflammatory food ?\n\u2063\n In various systematic reviews & meta analysis dairy has been shown to have NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INFLAMMATORY MARKERS in the body and has actually been found to have a significant anti-inflammatory effect in certain populations!\u2063\n\u2063\nObviously If you suffer from milk allergy, then milk is not an option for you \u2063\n\u2063\nSo why is it that people want to eliminate dairy? \u2063\n\u2063\nIt seems to get a bad reputation due to its saturated fat content.  And we all know saturated  fat has been linked to potentially cause inflammation (however this topic is also under review) \u2063\n\u2063\nWhen you read through systematic  reviews though, all dairy products including full fat versions of dairy have very similar anti-inflammatory effects.\u2063\n\u2063\nThese results could be due to a variety of reasons.  Some studies have reported the existence of over 400 different types of fat in milk with varying fatty acid chain lengths & saturation levels which may likely result in different effects on inflammatory markers.\u2063\n\u2063\nAlso, if you think about it...there are plenty of fermented dairy products (I .e. greek yogurt) that promote serve as probiotics & promote healthy gut bacteria, so this has an effect on \u2b07\ufe0ftotal inflammation in the body\u2063\n\u2063\nPeople buy into these MARKETING STRATEGIES on \u201cREDUCING INFLAMMATION IS KEY\"\"\u2063\n... However,  inflammation is not necessarily a bad thing (only when we refer to chronic inflammation). This is a natural body process to help with healing.. so some inflammation is a good sign.\u2063\n\u2063\nMost healthy people arent living their lives in an inflamed status \nSTOP FEARING DAIRY OR MILK\n\nSHARE\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c",
