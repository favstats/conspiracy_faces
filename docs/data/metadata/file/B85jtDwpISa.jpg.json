    "description": "When I look into the eyes of these 6 illuminati figures I can see pure evil. If eyes are the window to the soul then I would describe them as soulless. They've sold their souls to satan.\n Former BBC presenter David Icke claims the Royals are half reptilian. Their power was earned because a human ancestor mated with reptilian aliens. \nThe pope also part of the illuminati is said to have a chair that folds into a statue of Baphomet. The kinights templar were accused of worshipping  Baphomet which was described as a heathen idol. The pope can be seen in numerous catholic  robes displaying the cross of the knights templar. --------------------------\n#antilluminati #killuminati #illuminaticonfirmed #illuminatipuppets #davidrockefeller #jacobrothschilds #rothchildsbankingcartel #rothschilds #popebenedictxvi #popefrancis #baphomet #antizionism #cabal #knightstemplar #templarcross #princephilip #queenelizabeth #reptilians #davidicke #chemtrails #gmo #flouride #stopnewworldorder #fuckpharma #fucknwo #antijesuits #fcknwo #wakeupworld #wakeupsheep #wideawake",
