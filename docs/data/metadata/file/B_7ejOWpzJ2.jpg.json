    "description": "Imagine, children shouting for their liberty, against\u00c2\u00a0a world fast morphing into the final touches of a prison planet and demanding answers to a slag-heap of censored questions. The next generation,\u00c2\u00a0screaming for the vindication of their futures in a world of gagged faces and celebratory immunity-suppression.\n\nI was sitting quietly contemplating the world when I saw this picture, and I can't stop thinking about it.\u00c2\u00a0It was shot in the 1960s by Shirley Baker and has nothing to do with coronavirus but it made me sit up with goosepimples and a fresh conviction for how art could, should restore us.\n\nMaybe things in the world sit alright with you. They don't sit alright with me. .\n.\nMost agree that the world is tearing into a great divide. We're watching history repeat itself, yet on a globally unprecedented scale battle of good versus evil. The confusion is who and what is which.\n\nTo me, it feels as though the world's filter is falling away daily to reveal the true nature of everything that just tickled us before and now is groping. That includes the art world. Art at its truest should surely move us to rebellion and instead I see artists decorating the walls of our global incarceration for institutional brownie points, or be visual technician for the trendy slogans marching us onto a cattle train. Artists of course, should do as they please, but I can't help dream feverishly of filling the gap for the voice of freedom.\n\nMaybe I'll delete this post. Or maybe I'll keep this picture here to remind me of this feeling.\u00c2\u00a0My Birth series began with a roaring mouth. I wonder where this roaring mouth could lead. This picture gives me hope. .\n.\nIt gives me hope for our power.\n\nWhat do you feel like screaming?\n\n#covid1984 #nonewnormal #saynotobillgates\n#givemelibertyorgivemedeath",
