    "description": "I am putting a heart on here because my heart goes out to everyone in California for many reasons.  Yes. I am thinking of my family, God children, and all my friends and my old neighbors from my many years living in California. For me, I was happy to get out in the earlier 2000s and I live for 80% less you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a surf town in Florida. Cleaner air. Cleaner water. And so much less money. I just sold my house a half a mile from the beach that is a three bedroom two bath on a half of an acre for 140,000 to a family that was fleeing from California. They are so happy here as well. There is a mass exodus from California now. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not judging on what people do with their masks, but the family I sold my house to got out just before it all began. #HealthNutNews #HolisticHealth #NaturalHealth #HealthFreedom #MedicalFreedom  #ErinElizabeth",
