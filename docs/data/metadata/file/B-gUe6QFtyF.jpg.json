This is time that we can spend encouraging others to make us look different.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus #pandemic has shut down the sports world for the time being and many states and countries have issued stay-at-home orders, the panelists each spoke about how they are using this time to better their relationship with #spouse, their #children and the #Lord.\u00a0\nMcCown, a Louisiana Tech standout who played 10 seasons primarily as a backup quarterback with five different NFL teams, stressed that it's important to realize that God either allowed or ordained this pandemic to happen. \u201cThis is intentional. God doesn\u2019t do anything by accident, even all the things that you read about in Job,\u201d McCown, 38, contended. \u201cGod either ordains or allows every circumstance or situation. He ordains it, meaning that He makes it happen. Or He allows it; He gives #permission for it to happen. This is just one of those things.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that we have gotten so busy in our lives, whether it's just going from #ballgame to ballgame or ball practice to ball practice or [taking] the kids to dance recitals and this and that and the other, that there is an element that we are missing.\u201d McCown, a father of six, then referenced something he heard California megachurch pastor Greg Laurie say a few weeks \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc",
