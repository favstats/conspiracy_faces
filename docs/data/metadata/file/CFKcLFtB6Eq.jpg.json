    "description": "\"\"I don't want to have kids or to get married' I told my now-husband, over 14 years ago, on our second date.\u2060\n\u2060\nI had never had the desire to become a mom, it seemed far too painful a task and far too vulnerable an undertaking, and far too selfless a job.\u2060\n\u2060\nThen a little over 9 years ago I became a mother because my heart took over my rational mind.\u2060\n\u2060\nI had no idea how motherhood would transform me and slay me open to reveal my deepest fears and deepest love.\u2060\n\u2060\nI had no idea how far I would go to protect these precious beings.\u2060\n\u2060\nI had no idea that the anxiety that I felt before having little ones would transform into panic attacks at the thought of them being harmed.\u2060\n\u2060\nBut I knew that I was determined to break the cycles that had enslaved me, my mother, and my sister because of rape culture.\u2060\n\u2060\nI quickly became determined to stand up and fight for all children, not just my own.\u2060\n\u2060\nI became a warrior the day I gave birth for the first time. I didn't know it at the time, but I realized it as soon as I realized why I was meant to become a mother.\u2060\n\u2060\nSo here we are. You, me, and this fight for the right to a carefree, innocent, joyful childhood for our children; a fight to end rape culture and create consent culture.\u2060\n\u2060\nI have never felt so fearless and empowered in my whole and wildly holy life.\u2060\n\u2060\nI have never felt so free and fiercely determined to protect my young, like a feral beast, deeply growling at the predators in the dark- knowing I have what it takes to defend them.\u2060\n\u2060\nThis has been the transformation.\u2060\n\u2060\nI've gone from scared, frightened, panicked, anxious, and feeling alone in my worries... to becoming bold, daring, vocal, confident, empowered and connected with other brave souls who also want to protect their young.\u2060\n\u2060\nWe are in this together and I'm so grateful, truly and honestly, thankful that you're here for this fight.\u2060\n\u2060\nI am hope, incarnate.\u2060\n\u2060\nAnd I will never give up- protecting and defending the rights of my children and yours.\u2060\n\u2060\nI will keep roaring loudly until all those who lurk in the shadow run out, into the light where they are burned by our truth and justice.\u2060\n\u2060\nWe can do this.\u2060\n\u2060\nIn solidarity,\u2060\nRosalia",
