    "description": "\ud83e\udda0 COVID+? \ud83e\udda0 This morning I woke up with abdominal pain. I decided to not call in because I hoped it was something I ate and would just pass. The pain intensified with every move I made and radiated all around my trunk; my core muscles became extremely weak and I had a difficult time doing simple tasks. After a nasopharyngeal swab test was performed, I was sent home on a mandatory leave as muscle aches/pain is one of the symptoms of COVID. I must have two negative COVID results before returning back to work.\n.\n.\n.\n\nI\u2019m just hoping it was food poisoning or the stomach flu, but I will be self-quarantining at home for the next week or so \ud83d\ude2b\ud83e\udd2e\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2695\ufe0f Currently feeling a bit better without any other symptoms than a dull, achy pain in my abdomen [image from 05/20]",
