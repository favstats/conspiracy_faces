We have been the first line of defense against #COVID19. \u2063\n\u2063\nNow health workers from all countries need priority access to a vaccine. This can be done, and would require countries to put aside and share with each other only a minimal amount of doses. This would help safeguard entire healthcare systems across the world.\u2063 \u2063\nIt\u2019s time to put #HealthworkersFirst and ensure that we get priority vaccines for #COVID19.
