    "description": "Have you ever met someone who thinks vaccines are necessary except the flu shot? Who thinks vaccines are safe except the flu shot? All vaccines are made with the same toxic adjuvants. All vaccines have failed to be tested against a true placebo in their clinical trials. All vaccines have the same faulty logic. So what makes the flu shot different? It's because the majority of its recipients are adults and adults can clearly and coherently detail the damage and injuries the vaccine caused them. Newborns can't do that yet so their responses are seen at 2,4,6,12 months etc as crying, screaming, shrieking, diarrhea, sleeping for days, as well as behavioral and cognitive changes.",
