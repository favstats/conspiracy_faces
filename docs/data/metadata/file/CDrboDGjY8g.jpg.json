    "description": "The former Beatle was shot dead outside the Dakota building in New York where he lived by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. Chapman was jailed for murder and is still in prison. The most popular conspiracy theory over Lennon's death is that he was killed by remote control. Those who believe this claim that Chapman was programmed by US government agents to kill Lennon and that they used the novel Catcher in the Rye as a signal to go ahead with the operation. But there appears to be very little motive for such an assassination by the US government other than a supposed dislike of the musician's radical views by the newly-elected Reagan administration.\nComment your thoughts below\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\nTurn on post notification to be updated \ud83d\udce3\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ConspiracyFiles #ConspiracyFiles2 #Reptilian #ShapeShifter #DarkWeb #Sheeple #WakeUpSheeple #CorporationSlayer #Rothschild #UncleSam #UncleScam #Area51 #Illuminati #NewWorldOrder #ConspiracyPic #ConspiracyJokes #ConspiracyFact #ConspiracyTheory #Conspiracy #ConspiracyFiles\n#hollyweirdisevil",
