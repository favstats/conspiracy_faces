    "description": "John 1:1-2 - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.\nJohn 1:14 - The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\nJohn 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\nMark 2:7-10 - Why does this fellow talk like that? He\u2019s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\u201d\nImmediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, \u201cWhy are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, \u2018Your sins are forgiven,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Get up, take your mat and walk\u2019? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d So he said to the man. \nMatthew 28:18 - Then Jesus came to them and said, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.",
