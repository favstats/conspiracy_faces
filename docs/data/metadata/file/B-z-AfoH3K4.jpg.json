If that's the case why are they listed right on the CDC website as such? \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Human\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" diploid...WI-38 and MRC-5 (there are others as well) clearly they don't want you to fully comprehend what you are allowing to be injected into your child. What's even worse is how they obtained these cells... They would puncture the sac of a pregnant woman at 14 to 16 weeks, put a clamp on the head of the baby, pull the head down into the neck of the womb, drill a hole into the baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head and attach a suction machine to remove the brain cells\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At 16 to 21 weeks, they would do prostaglandin abortions where a chemical is injected into the womb causing the woman to go into a mini-labor and pass the baby. Fifty percent of the time, the baby would be born alive, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop them. They would simply open up the abdomen of the baby with no anesthesia, and take out the liver and kidneys, etc. Make No Mistake the Abortions Were Done This Way To Ensure Intact Organs and Tissues For Research. \nSo do you live in a sane society or dealt cult masquerading as a society? You know the answer....now you just have to be brave enough to face this reality head on.",
