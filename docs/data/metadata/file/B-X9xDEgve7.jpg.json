    "description": "Over the past years we have witnessed an exposing of the malicious nature of the mainstream media, as well as associated political movements which rely upon carefully crafted rhetoric designed to instil victim mentality and create conflict between groups.\u2063\n\u2063\nMost disturbing is how these sorts of nasty tactics have wormed their way into what were considered trustworthy professional disciplines, often through the pressure of activism in the HR departments. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe past year or so has seen the American Psychology Association adopt poorly thought out gender theories as well as classify \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d, (a dubious term emerging from corrupt grievance and gender studies disciplines), as a mental disorder. From the disingenuous framing of disparities such as the gender wage gap to selectively misquoting individuals in order to influence public hysteria via \u201ccancel culture\u201d, the media has shown itself to be wilfully complicit in dispensing any and all moral responsibility to reporting truthfully, in a non bias manner.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis has created an unlimited ceiling to the lack of trust which most people view both the media and most professional institutions and it is unclear how society will be able to reconcile this, especially in a crisis in which society at large depends upon accurate and non biased sources of information.\u2063\n\u2063\nPlease share your thoughts below.",
