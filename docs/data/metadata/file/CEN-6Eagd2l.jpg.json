Remember that we are in the most important days and impeccable lawful and peaceful behaviour is of the utmost importance. We have no room for unnecessary drama or accidental infiltration. We do what we do best on the internet. THIS is where we are most powerful. Keep doing all the good work and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see their bait for what it is... and like usual, sit back and keep researching while our enemy clumsily destroys themselves. God speed patriots. See something, say something! Be vigilant and know that Light wins. \n#weareq #darktolight #sheepnomore #sheeplenomore #takebackcontrol #factsmatter #themoreyouknow #worldpeaceiscoming #frensforever",
