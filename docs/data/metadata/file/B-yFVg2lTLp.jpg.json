    "description": "A nursing home in Kirkland, #Washington was #groundzero for the initial deadly spread of the #Coronavirus in the U.S., but one of its older residents felt #God #heal her as she hovered #neardeath.\nThe Life Care Center facility in Kirkland became the source of the first major outbreak of #COVID19, with 101 of its senior residents #diagnosed with the potentially deadly #pestilence and 34 ultimately succumbing.\nOne of its residents, Geneva Wood, 90, had spent several months there recovering from a #stroke. Only a few days before she was to return home, the #disease struck many within its walls and the administrators placed the residents on #lockdown.\nA few days later, Wood began to feel #feverish. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I had the virus until I had the #virus. I had no #symptoms of it before,\u201d Wood told CBN.\nWood credits God for her #survival. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t have been for my #faith in God and my #family and their #prayers and all their families and the church and everything\u2026the faith and prayers pulled me through,\u201d Wood explained.\nEven while she was alone, in isolation, she felt God with her. On one particular dark night she thought she was #dying.\n\u201cI could feel #Godspresence. His hands were on my body and I could feel His #presence and I\u2019d wake up and I could feel these hands and I\u2019d go back to sleep. Through the night, \u2019cause I\u2019d wake up, I couldn\u2019t see His face, but I could feel His hands and I knew He was with me and I made it through the night,\u201d Wood told CBN.\nThe hands of #Jesus brought #healing, just as they did in the pages of the New Testament. \u201cUntil you\u2019ve felt God\u2019s presence and his hands on you, it\u2019s something else. If it hadn\u2019t have been for Him, I couldn\u2019t have done it. And I wasn\u2019t alone because He was with me all the time,\u201d she continued.\nOne doctor at the facility brought her a #Bible and spent time reading her favorite #scriptures. \u201cAt first all I said was Psalm 23, but he would read to me every morning,\u201d she told CBN.\nWood\u2019s family called her turnaround \u201c#miraculous.\u201d\nAs the Jewish people gather around the world to celebrate #Passover tomorrow, it is worth considering that God sheltered Geneva Wood in his arms from the deadly plague, just as he \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc",
