This is the first lesson I was taught when I was learning about yogic science and holistic health. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even emphasise enough the importance of deep breathing and inhaling fresh oxygen. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boon for great health and well -  being which has had a drastic impact on my health. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never felt better.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe only time I wear a mask is to protect my self from inhaling harmful pollution on the road. Otherwise, I would never deprive myself from this one gift god has given me. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI feel completely helpless and sad to see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the world right now. Who would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known, simply breathing fresh air would be considered a crime and a threat to the society. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWake up guys! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let them take one of the most precious gifts god has given you. YOUR BREATH and YOUR HEALTH is important. \n\n#scamdemic #plandemic2020 .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#spiritualawakening #heal #spiritualpath #breathe #higherconciousness #higherself #wisdom #knowledgeispower #knowledge #mindbodysoul #indoctrination #mentalslavery #staywoke #paralleluniverse #lightworker #quotes #oxygen #spiritualjourney #spiritscience #healthcoach #holistichealer #holistichealthcoach #holistichealth #spiritualhealth #health  #reality #truth #truthseeker",
