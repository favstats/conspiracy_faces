    "description": "Joseph McCarthy is the most unjustly demonized individual in American history.\nIn February 1950, McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, launched a massive campaign against alleged Communists and Soviet agents working for, and perhaps spying on, the U.S. government. In Senate hearings stretching across much of the first half of the 1950s, he accused numerous U.S. government employees, including many in the State Department, of being Communists or even agents of Soviet Intelligence. He was bitterly opposed by powerful members of the Senate, by numerous high-ranking officials within both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, and by the overwhelming preponderance of the press corps.\nEven historians who investigate and expose Soviet espionage penetration of the U.S. government claim that \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s charges were, in fact, based on thin evidence\u201d and that he \u201cuse[d] anticommunism for partisan purposes.\nBut evidence accumulated from a variety of sources\u2014including Soviet archives\u2014since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s shows that McCarthy\u2019s charges were, in numerous cases, neither false nor hysterical\u2014but correct.\nTake a look at today's social and academic political climates and then tell me if McCarthy was paranoid.\n#nwo #cabal #globalelite #soros #rothschild #bilderberg #rockerfeller #mindcontrol  #propaganda #feartactics #manipulation #qanon #stormiscoming #calmbeforethestorm #trusttheplan #redpill #redpillnation #marxism #socialism #communism #gunownersofamerica #nra #2ndamendment #protectthesecond #takebackcontrol #learnandunlearn #questioneverything #walkaway",
