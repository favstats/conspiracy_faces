    "description": "Did you know that babies who aren't breastfed are known to develop smaller brains?\n\nDid you also know that all drugs must have placebo controlled trials, whereas vaccines do not?\n\nDid you know in 1986 a law was passed to ensure vaccine manufacturers aren't liable for any injuries or deaths that happen to your child? Blanket immunity from lawsuits.\n\nDo you know what happened instead? A 75 cent tax was added to each vaccine, and that money would go towards the vaccine court set up , and from then on all injuries would be paid by our tax dollars!!\n\nDid you know almost 4 billion has already been paid out, 30,000 injuries a year, and it's been estimated that only 1% of injuries are reported!!\n\nIsn't it time we stand up for our rights? For our children? For our future?\n\nThinking about making this meme a quote on some tshirts, hoodies, and onesies, let me know what you think. Please start speaking up. I will do my best to share videos, to speak myself in videos, and to share injured victims stories. This account was deleted by IG and that's why I remade it with an underscore at the end. They will not shut me up till I'm dead. \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u2030 @vaccinesaregenocide_ \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u201d",
