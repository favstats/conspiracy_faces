    "description": "In a stunning turn of events, Surgeon General Jerome Adams explained in an interview on live XM radio, that the Coronavirus Task Force has, effectively, dumped the Bill Gates/CDC/WHO predictive contagion model, and is now working with the real data.\nHe explained on the Sirius XM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Dailyhost Alex Marlow, that given the new data, businesses will begin to re-open as early as May, others in June.\nThis runs contrary to the out-and-out fear-mongering of Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates who have made a media tour, threatening the public that businesses may not re-open for six months to a year, or until and unless governments purchase their conveniently patented, big-pharma vaccination.\nAccording to Dr. Adams:\n\u201cWhat the American people need to know now is we actually have data, and so we\u2019re tracking that data\"\"\"\"\nBefore this about-face, which appears to have come as an order from the Trump administration in\u00a0 consultation with the findings of Dr. Adams, the task force was working with\u2019predictive models\u2019, which had been created by the Bill Gates dominated WHO and CDC. Dr. Fausti\u2019s control over the CDC has been criticized in the past for its for-profit motive in handling a range of illnesses from HIV to H1NI.\nIn those inflated, \u2018fear-based\u2019 models, the deaths of millions worldwide, and hundreds of thousands in America, were touted. These were used as the basis for what many experts have termed a \u2018grossly disproportionate response\nthe task force was working with predictive models, frequently criticized because of their tendency to exaggerate the possible effect of the virus on the United States. Models predicting the deaths of millions and hundreds of thousands in America appear to be overblown, as the real-time data is showing the death count much lower.\n\"\"\"\"We're following this data every single day, and we\u2019re giving that data to communities so that they can make informed and intelligent decisions about when and where to reopen,\u201d he said.\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q",
