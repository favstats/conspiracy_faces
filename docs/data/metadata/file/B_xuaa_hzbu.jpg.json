    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nA former #CIA operative argued former FBI Director #JamesComey and former CIA Director #JohnBrennan must be given the #deathpenalty over their roles in the #Russia investigation. \nBryan Dean Wright appeared on Fox News on Saturday and reacted to the FBI\u2019s treatment of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, which was revealed in a cache of FBI records unsealed late Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the death penalty,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd boy, oh boy, I tell you, if I could flip the switch myself, I\u2019d do it. These men are traitors.\u201d The records disclosed bombshell new information about how the FBI planned to interview Gen. Flynn and whether the goal was to get him to tell the truth or catch him in a lie so that he could be charged with a crime or removed from his position. \u201cWe have these unelected bureaucrats who had decided they\u2019re going to take out a member of the Trump administration,\u201d Wright told Fox News, later adding, \u201cWe have this very clear case of James Comey and a whole bunch of other folks on the senior level of the FBI trying to get people fired. Not because the facts warranted it or the law called for it, but because of their own personal, partisan agendas.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
