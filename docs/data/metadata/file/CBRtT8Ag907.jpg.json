Our entire society is based on nobody calling out the lies and evil publicly because of fear of retribution. You're being programmed to enjoy your enslavement.... programmed to fall passionately in love with the tyrannical masters...mostly out of fear. When you're in fear, the facts don't matter. What does matter is making sure you stay safe inside your slavery. Part of that programming means that the master can lie and that lie isn't questioned, not because it's true, but because master supplies safety to the people who don't question the lie in front of master.\n\nPeople aren't believing the government because the government is telling the truth. Everyone knows the government is lying. People are believing the government lies, not because they're true, but because it increases their feelings of safety and security. Our culture is based on violence and tyranny being directed against anyone questioning the lies, while the people not calling out the lie are celebrated, adorned and showered with positive re-enforcement. Our entire society is based on mind control and schizophrenic fracturing...not logic, morality, fairness, ethics or democracy. Far off the path we have become...Try to get back on the path, we must.",
