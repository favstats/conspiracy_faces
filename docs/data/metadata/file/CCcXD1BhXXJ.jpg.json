The reality is that the pandemic is being pushed forward.\n.\nIt should be obvious to the whole world by now that no effort or focus on health or healing has occurred YET. \n.\n97% of people are Asymptomatic - people contract corona and have no symptoms. This is because they are healthy enough.\n.\nThose who are already health-compromised get sick, and this is a fact of life that cant be stopped except for a focus on and improvement of health itself.\n.\nMasks dont create health, or change health status.  It is an illusion that has to stop, or this will never end.\n.\nThe vaccine doesnt create health either, and new viruses appear constantly.\n.\nThe whole world should be focused on health. But the focus is on money - vaccines.  Propoganda is pushing it forward, and participation is allowing it to happen.\"\" -Paul Leendertse",
