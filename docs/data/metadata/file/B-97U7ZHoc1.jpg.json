    "description": "\u201d In a stunning turn of events, the US Surgeon General Jerome Adams has effectively dumped the Bill Gates/CDC/WHO predictive contagion model and is now working with the real data.\u201d This is unbelievable news. And it is sticking a needle in the overinflated out and out fear mongering balloon that Fauci and Bill Gates have been falsely inflating and propagating.\n\nThe US Surgeon General stated \u201cwhat the American people need to know now is that we actually have data and so we are tracking that data.\u201d According to the US Surgeon General, the new data suggests that businesses will begin to reopen as early as early May!\n\nThe main stream media will not release this information. So it is up to us to spread this information far and wide. The fake media (which we have ALL seen whether we all admit it or not) will try to discredit this news, minimize it or even demonize it. It is up to us to spread this information far and wide. This was released on XM radio during the Breitbart News Daily hosted by Alex Markow and was released on Monday, April 13, 2020. Pass this on. There is nothing to fear but fear itself. It\u2019s time to stop this ridiculousness and get back to making this world a better place! Pay it forward and pass it on!
