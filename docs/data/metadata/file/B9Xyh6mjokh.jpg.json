    "description": "When fighting injustice, sometimes our silence speaks more powerful than words.\n\u2014\nToday, as a wave of calculated propaganda circulates social media and sponsored medical professionals regurgitate one-liners, I will be observing a moment of silence. \u2014\nFor every baby who never woke up... For every person injured and ignored... For every child who\u2019s voice was taken... For every child they won\u2019t let in school...\n\u2014 \u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\u201d Upton Sinclair\n#trumphelpus #nonewnormal #saynotobillgates",
