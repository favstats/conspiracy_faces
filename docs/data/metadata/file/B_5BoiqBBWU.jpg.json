    "description": "The #WhiteHouse #petition demanding an investigation into the Gates Foundation for \u201c#crimesagainsthumanity\u201d has surpassed a whopping 502,000 signatures \u2013 five times the amount needed for a response from the White House.\n\nThe \u201c#WethePeople\u201d petition asks the U.S. government to compel Congress to investigate the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, claiming that \u201cCongress and all other governing bodies are derelict in duty until a thorough and public inquiry is complete.\u201c As the organizer of the petition states:\n\nAs we look at events surrounding the \u201c#COVID19 pandemic,\u201d various questions remain unanswered. On Oct. 18th of 2019, only weeks prior to ground zero being declared in #Wuhan, #China, two major events took place. One is \u201cEvent 201,\u201d the other is the \u201cMilitary World Games,\u201d held in none other than Wuhan. Since then a worldwide push for vaccines & biometric tracking has been initiated.\n\nAt the forefront of this is Bill Gates, who has publicly stated his interest in \u201creducing population growth\u201d by 10-15%, by means of vaccination. Gates, UNICEF & WHO have already been credibly accused of intentionally sterilizing Kenyan children through the use of a hidden HCG antigen in tetanus vaccines.\n\nCongress & all other governing bodies are derelict in duty until a thorough and public inquiry is complete. #VaccineAgenda #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
