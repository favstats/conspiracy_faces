If you still think these riots are random and ppl are just mad and destroying their OWN COMMUNITIES, then idk what to tell you. from the \u201cstrategically\u201d placed bricks to the misinformation in the news. For those with open eyes it\u2019s obvious. Makes perfect sense when you think about the media\u2019s perspective. These ANTIFA agents (mostly white) are vandalizing and causing violence and it seems the media is capturing it all to make it seem like the peaceful protesters are the ones getting violent. It\u2019s all orchestrated. Not all cops are bad. There\u2019s been evil members of the cabal placed into certain positions to help steer the narrative. Even George Floyds own family are telling us to stop destroying our community and that this is tarnishing Georges memory. Don\u2019t fall for it. The deepstate is panicking, you will see more crazy shit until election time. THEN the real fun begins (Q). But until then get the popcorn out and try. It to get too emotional.  #qanon #protest #georgefloyd #ANTIFA #georgesoros #hillaryclinton #cabal. #wwg1wga #wakeup #falseflag #questioneverything #thegreatawakening #yourvoicematters #peacefulprotest #knowledgeispower #meditation #wearethenewsnow #news #billgates #disclosure",
