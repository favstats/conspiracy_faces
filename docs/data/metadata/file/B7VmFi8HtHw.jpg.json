    "description": "Northern Health officials are going through their records looking for un-immunized children in the Peace. \nIn an effort to control outbreaks by identifying children who are not fully immunized - Northern Health staff will begin checking immunization records for school age children - and identify children in the school system whose records are missing and incomplete. \u201cFamilies of these children may be contacted. They will be asked to provide us with immunization information required under the regulation,\u201d says Dr. Raina Fumerton, acting Medical Health Officer for Northern Health.\n\nThe moves come with the province\u2019s new Vaccination Status Reporting regulation coming into effect this school year, supporting gathering of all public documents by public health. The regulation applies to all schools within BC, including home school. It does not apply to children attending schools in First Nations communities. \u201cWe will also let families know where children can receive immunizations,\u201d adds Fumerton.\n\nIf you are contacted, it may mean that we need to update some information. It may not mean that your child is missing immunizations,\u201d she added in a letter sent to SD59 parents.\n\nNorthern Health notes collecting the info allows officials to connect with families faster, and officials note this allows them to control outbreaks by identifying children who are not fully immunized.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#parentalrights #vaccinationchoice #medicalfreedom #betweenmeandmydoctor #dothereasearch #medicalfreedomofchoice #protruth #vaccines #childrenshealth #doctorpatientrights #informedconsent #immunizations #medicalexemption #medicalrights #doctorsofcalifornia #californiadoctors #californiapidoctors",
