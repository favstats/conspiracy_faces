This ruling forces the #UnitedStates to allow all #CentralAmericans into our country.\n\nLiterally, anyone can claim the new refugee status.\n\nThis will essentially open US borders for good.\n\nVia The Central Tibetan Administration:\n\nIt is unlawful for governments to return people to countries where their lives might be threatened by the climate crisis, a landmark ruling by the United Nations #humanrights committee has found.\n\nThe judgment \u2013 which is the first of its kind \u2013 represents a legal \u201ctipping point\u201d and a moment that \u201copens the doorway\u201d to future protection claims for people whose lives and wellbeing have been threatened due to global heating, experts say.\n\nTens of millions of people are expected to be displaced by global heating in the next decade.\n\nThe judgment relates to the case of Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of #Kiribati, which is considered one of the countries most threatened by rising sea levels. He applied for protection in #NewZealand in 2013, claiming his and his family\u2019s lives were at risk.\n\nThe committee heard evidence of overcrowding on the island of South Tarawa, where Teitiota lived, saying that the population there had increased from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable, which had led to violence and social tensions.\n\nHe also spoke of the lack of fresh water and difficulty growing crops due to salinity of the water table causing serious health issues for his family. He said that as Kiribati was predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was endangered by remaining there.\n\nThe New Zealand courts rejected Teitiota\u2019s claim for protection.",
