    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nDr Anthony Fauci said that while he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that a #coronavirus vaccine will be available by the start of 2021, he thinks it unlikely the U.S. would reach #herdimmunity if too many people refused to take it.\n\nThe top infectious disease expert told CNN he would settle for a vaccine that was 70 percent to 75 percent effective but warned it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that the U.S. would be able to quell the outbreak if 30 percent of the population refused to be vaccinated.\n\nFauci\u2019s concerns echo those of Bill Gates who also warned last week that the \u201cfinal hurdle\u201d for a new Coronavirus vaccine will be ensuring that the public actually takes it.\n\nNY Post reports: Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that the incomplete protection and the fact that many people say they will skip the vaccine makes it \u201cunlikely\u201d that the nation will achieve sufficient immunity to stem the outbreak.\n\nA recent CNN poll found one-third of #Americans said they would not try to get a vaccine \u2014 even if it is widely available and low cost.\n\nHerd immunity is achieved when a sufficient percentage of a population is immune to an infectious disease, either through prior illness or vaccination.\n\nIn the next three months, three vaccines are expected to be studied in major clinical trials \u2014 but \u201cthere is a general anti-science, anti-authority, anti-vaccine feeling among some people in this country \u2014 an alarmingly large percentage of people, relatively speaking,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nGiven the influence of #antivaxxers, he added, \u201cWe have a lot of work to do\u201d to educate people on the truth about vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d said Fauci, a member of the #WhiteHouse task force on the pandemic. \u201cAnyone [who] thinks it will be easy is not facing reality. It\u2019s going to be very difficult.\u201d He said the government has a vaccine education program to spread the message. \u201cWe have a program right now that\u2019s going to be extensive in reaching out to the community,\u201d he said. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #VaccineAgenda #CoViD1984",
