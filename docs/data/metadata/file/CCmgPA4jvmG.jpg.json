    "description": "Wow! Over 2000 new peeps in the last 72 hours\ud83c\udf89  thought it might be fun to share a little \u201cGet to Know You post\u201d:\n.\n\ud83c\udf1fOh hey! I\u2019m Rachel Pekarek (pronounce: Peh-Car-Eck) \ud83d\ude18\n.\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 I serve the Most High God YHWH and His Son Jesus. Not man. Not social media. Not a business and certainly not money. \n.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 I recently married (COVID elopement style) the most incredible man I affectionately call Ogre. He loves Christ. He pushes me. Supports me. Oh and he\u2019s the hottest man on the planet. #IWin\n.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 I am a voracious reader and researcher. I nearly never watch TV, I hate most movies and despise Hollywood. Because of that - I would rather be watching a documentary, reading The Word if God or commentaries/Christian literature, pouring over blogs/videos and increasing my knowledge and understanding.\n.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Ive endured 40 surgeries in my life from tonsils, to a complete colectomy at 15 years old due to an acute life-threatening form of #UlcerativeColitis\n.\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Ive been very blessed to build a 7-Figure business  in Network Marketing but believe in being #CONTRARIAN - for instance: My husband and I both drive 2011 SUVs. #WarOnDebt #TeamHeart\ud83d\udc99\n.\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 I am PRO LIFE. PRO GUN. PRO AMERICA. ANTI VAX. ANTI PHARMA. ANTI FAKE NEWS. I believe hugely in ADVOCACY and #Truth. In my spare time I love exposing the sickness involving the Elites / Cabal in this world. #Ephesians511 #RedpillingTheWorld\n.\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Travel is my love language. Culture. New foods. Experiences. Ahhhh!! I miss global adventures. \n.\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 My favorite colors are: pink, leopard and glitter. #YAAAAAS \n.\n9\ufe0f\u20e3 One of the greatest callings in my life is to make a difference in the realm of human (child, specifically) trafficking and caring for orphans. I\u2019ve been advocating these causes aggressively since 2012. \n.\n\ud83d\udd1f Some of my happiness moments revolving around hosting people, and especially FEEDING THEM! \ud83c\udf54\ud83e\udd69\ud83c\udf73\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf70\u2615\ufe0f So satisfying!! \n.\n\u2728\u2728 Now Share Something about you \u2728",
