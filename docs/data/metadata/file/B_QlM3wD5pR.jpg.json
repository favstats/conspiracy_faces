I respect and love everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19. I am truly sorry for your loss and I so wish you weren\u2019t experiencing such grief and pain. It truly is a heartbreak, and it\u2019s painful. .\nI am forever thankful and grateful to those of you who are risking your life to help others get well and are then making the sacrifice to not be able to be with the people you love. I could never do what you do! So, thank you to all healthcare workers and first responders. \ud83d\udc9c\n.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m angry about. The estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in 2020. The estimated cancer cases are 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed and 606,520 cancer deaths in the United States. It is estimated that 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer in the year 2020 - statistics taken from the American Cancer Society. Yet, the government and big pharmaceutical companies continue to sell us the products that cause these deaths and new cases. They don\u2019t stop production. IN FACT, they pump out more. They don\u2019t test the safety of the chemicals, chemicals haven\u2019t had safety testing since 1976. More people will die from cancer (and have been for years) yet they\u2019re not telling the American people to stop using and buying Lysol, Clorox, Febreeze, Tide, perfumes, colognes, body lotions, hand soaps, Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder, wax melts, candles, dyer sheets, over the counter drugs, prescribed drugs, etc., oh and our food. ( let\u2019s not even go there) The things that the FDA KNOWS CAUSES CANCER, yet you can buy them in any store.\n.\nHi, there is a documentary on Netflix called Stink. Do yourself and your children a HUGE favor, and watch it. Now. Then message me so we can go off together \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb .\nOnly 5% of cancer is genetic. 90-95% of cancer is outside of your genes - it\u2019s environmentally. From what we eat, breathe in, apply topically, clean our homes with, wash our bodies in, wash our clothes in and so fourth. .\nWHY AREN\u2019T WE MAKING THIS A BIG DEAL?! *continued in the comments*\n#saynotobillgates #nonewnormal",
