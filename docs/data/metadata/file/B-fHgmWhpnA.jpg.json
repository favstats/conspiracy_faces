Fauci says that the #UnitedStates will not come out of lockdown until there are no \u201cnew cases\u201d of #coronavirus, prompting some to question precisely how long that will be.\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s #WhiteHouse briefing, Fauci, who has become the face of #America\u2019s response to the #coronavirus, was asked by a reporter whether social distancing measures will be imposed until there is a drug or vaccine to treat #COVID19. \u201cI think if we get to the part of the curve that Dr. Birx showed yesterday when it goes down to essentially no new cases, no new deaths at a period of time. I think it makes sense that you will have to relax #socialdistancing,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe one thing we hopefully would have in place, and I believe we will have in place, is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who was infected, isolate them and then do contact tracing,\u201d he added.\n\nThe prospect of there ever being zero new coronavirus cases appears to be a very long way off, leading some to question if Fauci was asking Americans to adopt social distancing indefinitely, or at least until a vaccine is available. \u201cFauci said that we can start to \u201crelax\u201d social distancing once there are \u201cno new cases, no deaths.\u201d Is it just me or is that completely batshit insane?\u201d asked Matt Walsh. \u201cThat would keep us in a lockdown for many months or years. And if the virus becomes endemic, forever. How can that be the plan?\u201d \u201cNo kidding. We would need to assume that any vaccine would be immediately available, 100% effective, 100% of the population has access to it, and 100% of the population takes it,\u201d commented another respondent. \u201cSounds like they\u2019ll eventually have to keep us \u201ctemporarily\u201d locked in our homes. No cars on the road. No people at stores or gas stations, and the national guard will start leaving a box of food on our doorsteps every 3 days. And everyone will be ok with it,\u201d added another.\n\n#Italy is already experiencing looting and #civilunrest as a result of lockdown measures.\n\nExperts have suggested that this could be a massive problem everywhere if authorities attempt to quarantine entire countries for too long.",
