Why are so many people complaining?! \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udf1f\n\nYou\u2019re not losing your freedoms or anything.\n\nIt\u2019s for your protection. It\u2019s totally your choice if you want to comply or not, but if you don\u2019t you will get cited with a misdemeanor. So what.\n\nOh, you\u2019re sick of staying at home? You\u2019ve binge watched all your favorite Netflix shows and now you\u2019re out of quarantine snacks? You only bought enough for 2 WEEKS?!? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \nYeah. This is gonna last way longer than that....\n\nWe\u2019re just telling you what time of day you can be outside, or when/if you\u2019re allowed to leave your home at all or not \ud83e\uddd0 You\u2019re not on house arrest. We just keep telling you over and over to stay home. \nWhat? You don\u2019t like your house? That\u2019s your fault.... stay inside it anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you need to stand in line for 4 hours to get your rations of groceries or anything. \ud83d\ude12 Who needs water and toilet paper anyway??? Or flour, sugar, hand soap, sanitizer, meat, medications or anything else for that matter. What, 2 isn\u2019t enough for you? Well, you should have already been stocked up! Can\u2019t afford it? That\u2019s your fault. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWe\u2019re only telling you how many people you\u2019re allowed to gather with at one time or not. Because you can\u2019t use your own best judgment to protect your own family or anything. Idiot. We know what\u2019s best. You elected us. Trust us. \ud83d\ude37\n\nWe always tell the truth. \u261d\ud83c\udffc And we always have your best interest in mind, and our bank accounts reflect that. Don\u2019t you watch the News?\n\nWe\u2019re the only ones who know which businesses, products, and careers are actually \u201cessential\u201d for you in your life, and which you can simply live without \ud83e\udd2a Obviously.\n\nIt\u2019s a choice.\n\n***continued in comments***",
