They had a choice but instead \u2013 instead - China covered up the outbreak in Wuhan,\"\" Pompeo told reporters. \"\"China is still refusing to share the information we need to keep people safe,\"\" Pompeo added. -France 24\n\nThis past weekend, Secretary Pompeo said there was \"\"enormous evidence\"\" that the coronavirus escaped from the Wuhan lab. On Wednesday, China said Pompeo \"\"doesn't have any\"\" evidence. \"\"I think this matter should be handed to scientists and medical professionals, and not politicians who lie for their own domestic political ends,\"\" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying during a press briefing in Beijing. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Event201",
