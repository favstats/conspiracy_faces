    "description": "This is a clip from the movie \u201cAmerican satan\u201d where the rock group named \u201cRelentless\u201d drops out of college to pursue their dreams of becoming an iconic group. So they move to the sunset strip where they\u2019re living out of their van and barely scraping by. So eventually they keep running into this weird guy who later proclaims himself to be \u201cthe devil\u201d and ask to meet with them to see how bad they wanted to become famous. In this clip, the man tells them that they need a human sacrifice and he will make them international icons! I\u2019m posting this because this is EXACTLY how it happens in the industry! Human sacrifices are made in order to achieve success! Kanye sacrificed his mother, Bruno Mars sacrificed his mother, Jennifer Hudson sacrificed her family, Drake sacrificed his uncle, Rihanna sacrificed her cousin and many more! #hollyweirdisevil",
