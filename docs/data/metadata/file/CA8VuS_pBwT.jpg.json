Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.\n\nThe danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.\n\nScandal in the making:\n\nThe report focuses on the \u201cmanifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures\u201d and warns that these are \u201cgrave\u201d. More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.\n\nWhy? \u201c(Because) a Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for non-Corona patients.\u201d",
