THIS IS WHERE WE'RE HEADING CHURCH. WE ARE TARGET ENEMY #1 TO SATAN & THE WORLD HE CONTROLS. WHAT WILL YOU ACTUALLY SUFFER WHEN THE TIRE MEETS THE ROAD? BETTER FIGURE IT OUT REAL QUICK. NO TIME FOR WISHY WASHY CHRISTIAN'S. YOU BOW TO THIS YOU'LL BOW TO IT ALL EVENTUALLY. CLING TO JESUS AS TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE WILL FACE NO WORSE THAN JESUS HIMSELF DID. HE SAYS THROUGH HIM WE CAN DO ALL THINGS. FAITH IS A CHOICE.

This is the spirit of the antichrist,\u00a0which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 4\u00a0You, dear children,\u00a0 are from God and have overcome them,\u00a0 because the one who is in you\u00a0is greater than the one who is in the world.\u00a05\u00a0They are from the world\u00a0and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.\u00a0 6\u00a0We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.\u00a0This is how we recognize the Spirit\u00a0of truth\u00a0and the spirit of falsehood.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\n.\n.\n#idonotconsent\n#wedonotconsent #freedomisgone #satanhatesyou #christian #dieforjesus #willyoudieforjesus #fightthesystem\n@realdonaldtrump \n@realcandaceowens \n@terrencekwilliams \n@donaldjtrumpjr \n@ginaguywarren \n@dbongino \n@jessewatters \n@tuckercarlsontonight \n@turningpointusa \n\n#PastorBrianWARren\n#MrUnbreakable\n@mrunbreakable22 \n@mrunbreakable22forjesus",
