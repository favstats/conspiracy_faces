    "description": "@avn.org.au It is unsurprising the lengths the mainstream media will go to misconstrue, misquote and misrepresent a person. After all, most of us are aware of where the mainstream media money trail leads\n.\n.\nHere we have a courageous young Australian woman, @isabellucas, who has simply stated that she does not agree with mandatory vaccination. All of a sudden, she is labelled an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and thrown into the spotlight for advocating for bodily autonomy\n.\n.\nFact: If you are not 100% in support of every single vaccine that is manufactured to be forcibly injected into every child, woman and man without taking into account any of their individual needs or concerns, then according to today\u2019s standards, you are an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d. If you dare to question the Religion of Vaccination, you are hunted down and discredited .\n.\nNo more! It is time for everyone to SPEAK UP! We know there are so many of you out there, every day people and high profile people alike, who do not agree with vaccines being forcibly pushed upon our population. The sooner we all stand together, the less the small group of people who are speaking up are able to be targeted and given a media-bashing for their right to an opinion. Whether it is speaking up publicly, or voicing your concerns to a friend, or simply asking someone whether they know what is in a vaccine, everyone has a part to play. Write to MPs, share information, do one small action today to encourage more transparency and open discussion on this topic .\n.\nSpeak now or forever roll up your sleeves \ud83d\udcaa\n.\n.\n.\n#vaccines #vaccination #immunisation #immunization #transparency #informedconsent #covid #coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19 #idonotconsent #wedonotconsent #standtogether #australia #avn",
