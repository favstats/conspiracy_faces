We are watching tech and big brother creep in like never before. Will we be able to regain the freedoms we once enjoyed, or are we forever chained by the fear of a looming viral infection? \nWe respect your right to stay home. In fact, if you are frightened or sick please do.\n\nBut we also respect the right to earn a living for your family, to not depend on a handout from an overbearing government. We respect your right to do what you need to do to take care of your family. We need to see our small businesses opened back up! We need to see our towns thriving again.\n\nWe respect your rights and your God-Given power of CHOICE. Our government can not override our these natural rights. We have done no harm, committed no crime but are treated so.\n\nNow is the time to stand up for those rights. Stand up for those who are shamed for wanting to support their families. Support local businesses that have chosen to stay open.\n\nBe a moralist!! What is right and what is wrong? If my actions do not harm another, then leave me be. My freedom doesn\u2019t end with your fears.\n\nRespect medical freedom. Respect freedom of choice. \u201cLiberty is not the power of doing what we like, but the right to do what we ought.\"\"\"\" - John Dalberg-Acton",
