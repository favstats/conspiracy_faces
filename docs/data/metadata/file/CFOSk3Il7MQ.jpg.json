The face covering is a demonic device designed to weaken and destroy - and Jerry insists that you wear it! He used to sell our #medjooldates at his farm stand and now he says he won\u2019t anymore. Fine by me. I do not intend to do business with evildoers and tyrants. Perhaps it\u2019s his farm stand manager Stephanie or his wife Maureen pushing this insane requirement. \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\ude37 Whoever is responsible, please. Let\u2019s make this expensive. I know that the employees and farm workers, never mind the farm stand customers, are not with this. If you care about them, please consider boycotting #rutizfarms",
