    "description": "African American boys are 236% more likely to be diagnosed with autism when vaxxed with MMR inside 36 Months.  This statistic was reported by a CDC whistleblower back in 2016, in the film Vaxxed.  The CDC has known this for YEARS but continues to bury it and continues to recommend the MMR vaccine within 12 months. \nWe need #blacklivesmatter to CALL OUT the CDC for burying statistics and endangering these innocent little ones. \nwww.1986theact.com (link in bio)\n\n#blacklivesmatter #juneteenth #vaxxed #autism #healthfreedom #cdcwhistleblower #CDCweseeyou",
