    "description": "Philadelphia Experiment involves covert U.S. Navy operations that led to time travel, teleportation, and mangled flesh. \nIn the first experiment, an alleged method of electrical field manipulation allowed the USS Eldridge to be rendered invisible on July 22, 1943 in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.\n\nThe second experiment was the teleportation and small-scale time travel of the USS Eldridge from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to Norfolk, Virginia, on October 28, 1943.\n\nHorrible tales of mangled sea-Men and sailors stuck within the metal of the USS Eldridge, with the USS Eldrige reappearing seconds later in the waters around Philadelphia. -\n-\nThe lore of the second experiment claims those on board the Andew Furuseth viewed the USS Eldridge and it's crew as they teleported into Norforlk momentarily before the ship returned to the waters of Philadelphia.\n.\nComment | Tag | Share\n.\nTurn ON Post Notifications\n-\n\u267b\ufe0f @pineal_activator \n#pinealgland #Knowledge #awareness #awakening #freedom #freethinkers #spiritualawakening #pinealActivator\n#consciousness #agenda21 #anonymous #conspiracy #newworldorder #w  #chemtrails #thematrixisreal #4biddenknowledge #conspiracytheories #truthseeker #sheeple #wakeup #thirdeye #spiritual #universe #spiritualgrowth #Woke #wokebreed #decalcifyyourpinealgland #higherconsciousness",
