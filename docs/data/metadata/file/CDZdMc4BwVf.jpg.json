    "description": "It\u2019s bad enough we have to deal with  Zuckerberg & his posse of \u201cfact checkers\u201d , add to this people\u2019s new found roles in censoring one another for expressing a difference of opinion & sprinkle it  with the self-censorship that we are all guilty of. The wait, I can\u2019t post that, because what will they think?  And then tell me what are left with? Mainstream media brainwashing the sleeping masses into imposing their corrupt agenda onto the masses.... i may not agree with everything that others think or say but I respect their right to say it. We should raise questions about what narratives are being \u2018corrected\u2019. What is a \u201cconspiracy\u201d or \u201cdisinformation\u201d? Should the state or big tech have the power to decide what is true or false in a free society? Just a couple of months ago the notion that there was a whole island where celebs and politicians gathered to commit horrible & devastating  acts on kids was a mere \u201cconspiracy\u201d and now there\u2019s a Netflix special about it... just something to think about before you try to shut people down for thinking differently than you...\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf31",
