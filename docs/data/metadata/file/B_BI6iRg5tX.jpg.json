    "description": "People are waking up! .\n.\n.\n\nA polarizing Democratic state lawmaker from Georgia reportedly broke party ranks on Tuesday \u2014 endorsing President Trump\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nState Rep. Vernon Jones told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he\u2019s backing Trump, in part, due to the president\u2019s handling of the economy and criminal justice reforms. \u201cThere are a lot of African Americans who clearly see and appreciate he\u2019s doing something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Jones told the paper. \u201cWhen you look at the unemployment rates among black Americans before the pandemic, they were at historic lows. That\u2019s just a fact,\u201d he said.\n\nJones serves portions of DeKalb and Rockdale counties, which are just outside of Atlanta. He previously served as the chief executive officer of DeKalb County.\n\nOn Tuesday he faced the ire of his fellow state Democrats for endorsing Trump.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#berniesanders #liberalismisamentaldisorder #conservativememes #nra #sjwcringe #liberalsnowflakes #HRCVideo #PedoVore #TheGreatAwakening #PatriotsFight #WeThePeople  #WhereWeGoOneWeGoAll #QAnon #TheStorm #WakeUp #RedPill #Debate #Politics\u00a0 #trump2020 #redwave #buildthewall #USA #fakenews #CNN #maga #stateoftheunion #joebiden #blacknotdemocrat #biden2020 #bidenmemes",
