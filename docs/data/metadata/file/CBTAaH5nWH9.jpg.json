    "description": "Look at these two!!! Then, they\u2019ll say if we do not comply, our children will not be able to attend school, nor will we be able to return to work. Then, our children will be labeled neglected and parents will be labeled health risks and inadequate guardians. Then, they will have \u201cgrounds\u201d to take our children. Why do you think I kept on screaming, \u201cINFORMED CONSENT MATTERS,\u201d when I almost lost custody of my two children for following through with my birthing plan, last August? They\u2019re coming for the rest of us. Blacks, Latinos, Whites, you name it! As we know, though, the black body is the first in line. FOH! We either stand as one, or we fall as a whole! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#BelieveBlackWomen #BelieveBlackMen #BelieveBlackChildren #support #action #foundation #parents #women #men #children #mothers #fathers #midwives #doulas #nevergiveup #family #naturalbirth #believewomen #civilrights #parentalrights #medicalrights #humanrights #patientrights #prochoice #informedconsent #awareness #unity #informedchoice",
