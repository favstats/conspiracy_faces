The girl left a message in the same place confirming that she needed help.\n\nFedrick informed the pilot, who alerted police. Officers were waiting at the terminal when the plane arrived in San Francisco and it was subsequently discovered that the girl was the victim of human trafficking.\n\nFedrick said: \u201cI\u2019ve been a flight attendant for 10 years and it\u2019s like I am going all the way back to when I was in training.\n\n\"\"And I was like, I could have seen these young girls and young boys and didn\u2019t even know. If you see something, say something.\u201d\n\nFedrick is still in touch with the girl, who is now attending college: \"\"I put my phone number on the note that I left for her and I guess she memorised it, so a few weeks later, she called me,\"\" she said.\n\nIn 2016, 2,000 people were arrested for human trafficking by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with 400 victims freed.\n\n#ourrescue #savethechildren #awareness #aware #childtrafficking #truth #truthbetold #elitepedorings #fallofthecabal #ourchildrenarenotforsale #nonewnormal #wedonotconsent #hollywierd #burnhollywood #seesomthingsaysomthing #endhumantrafficking #endchildtrafficking #beavoiceforthevoiceless #corruption #crimesagainthumanity #corruptgovernmentsworldwide",
