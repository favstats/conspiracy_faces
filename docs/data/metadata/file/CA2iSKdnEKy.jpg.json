    "description": "So basically to summarise, mainstream media warns us to:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Listen to celebrities about vaccines. Unless they are raising concerns about vaccines. Then don\u2019t listen to them\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Listen to doctors about vaccines. Unless they are raising concerns about vaccines. Then don\u2019t listen to them\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Listen to reputable sources of information. Unless they are raising concerns about vaccines. Then don\u2019t listen to them\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Listen to the people and organisations that have a vested interest in vaccine production. Because people who raise concerns about vaccines obviously have so much to gain from being ridiculed and marginalised by society\n.\n.\nWhen is the mainstream media going to drop the \u201canti vaxxer\u201d \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d narrative?\nIt sounds like they\u2019re getting a little desperate. Don\u2019t you think?\n.\n.\n@9news #avn #australia #vaccines #vaccination #experts #conspiracytheory #conspiracy #conspiracists #covid #covid19 #covid_19 #idonotconsent #DoUTrustUrGov",
