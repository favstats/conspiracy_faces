    "description": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates is bankrolling a company that plans on launching a $1 billion network of satellites to provide live-streaming coverage of almost \u201ccorner\u201d of the earth.\n\nEarthNow\u00a0plans on launching 500 plus satellites into our atmosphere, providing its users with near instantaneous video feedback with only one second of delay.\n\nWhile this may sound like something from a futuristic sci-fi movie, it is very much a real thing.\n\nAll a customer of the surveillance network would have to do is flip on their smart phone or tablet to get instant, live access to what\u2019s going on in any part of the world.\n\nUsers can watch the weather, detect forest fires the moment they start, watch volcanoes the instant they start to erupt and track the migration of large whales, the company boasts.\n\nWhile that all sounds benevolent enough, users can also\u00a0\u201cobserve conflict zones and respond immediately when crises arise, assist the media in telling stories from around the world, catch illegal fishing ships in the act, and instantly create \u201cliving\u201d 3D models of a town or city, even in remote locations.\u201d The obvious big question is who are the \u201cusers\u201d of this technology. According to\u00a0Wikipedia, the company expects its initial customers to include \u201cgovernments and large enterprises.\u201d This is nothing less than a total surveillance of the entire planet instigated by the Cult through the power of their controlled Technocrats.",
