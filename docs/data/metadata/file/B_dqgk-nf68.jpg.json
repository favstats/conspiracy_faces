It's appreciated more than you could imagine. Some of the comments on YT and FB and here on IG have touched me deeply. I don't even know how to adequately express my gratitude. To all who have been supportive and grateful, please hold the intention for the outcome to reveal true intentions and allow us a to evolve beyond our ethnicities, race, color, creed, religion or anything else that makes us individuals. \nThere have been a number of questions that have come in so this video and the next try to cover a few things including censorship and distractions. Each must follow their own path. The rewards or the consequences are yours and yours alone. My goal is to awaken and help people become empowered with the knowledge needed so that they are not able to be taken advantage of anymore. Once you have knowledge, you can no longer be victimized. \nRemember we go live on all social media platforms every Monday evening at 8:15 pm New York time. And don't forget to use the new registered hashtag: #wechangetheworld\n\n#covid_19 #covid #conspiracy #corona #patriots#patriot #patriotic #patrioticnation#DrButtar #AHEADMAP#AdvancedMedicine#AdvancedMedicineConference#IADFW #Fitness #Longevity#livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts#knowledge #truth #empowerment#freedomwriters #livefree#livefreeordie #populationcontrol#whistleblower #soldiers",
