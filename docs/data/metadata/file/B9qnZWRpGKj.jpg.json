    "description": "Not panicking here, just heading out to buy some colloidal silver.  I usually travel with a battery pack to make my own (my mama taught me, I definitely inherited some of my gift from her, she's amazing), but they sell it here in Bali so didn't need it this time.  Get you some off Etsy or somewhere, it kills viruses.  I wouldn't be without it.\n.\n.\nNo need to raid the TP shelves here cos we got plenty of bumguns all over Asia.  Water is life, TP is....... Fill the blank! .\n.\nNo, seriously though stay safe out there, soulfam, we're being tested real hard right now, there's a virus in the programme... Or maybe the programme was corrupt from when it was first coded.  Either way, we need to recode it and first step?  Start reclaiming your health sovereignty, we need to become more self-reliant and stop being such slaves to the system.  Create new systems that are more in harmony with mama earth rather than patriarchal controllers, you hear me?  While I'm at it I might pick up some echinacea too. .\n.\n#colloidalsilver #covid_19 #coronavirus #333 #christconsciousness #crown #sovereignty #internalmonarchy #healthfreedom #echinacea #herbalism #witchywoman #sacredfemininerising #gaia #pachamama #ai #virusinthesystem",
