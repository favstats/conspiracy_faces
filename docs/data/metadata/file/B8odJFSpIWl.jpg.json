    "description": "I think it\u2019s incredibly important to make the home as safe, toxic-free, and eco-friendly as possible. There are many things one can simple do to achieve a much more harmonious environment at home, before i list a few things you can start with - comment below any ideas and suggestions you have of your own, lets help some people out \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\u2014\nYou can swap any LED lightbulbs for incandescent bulbs instead. LED\u2019s cause major damage including retina damage. Use natural beeswax candles also. Turn wifi routers off when not using (especially during sleep!) OR swap wireless router to wired router and wire your computers and phones to reduce the wifi radiation. Remove the smart meter and replace it with analog - THIS IS YOUR RIGHT. Reduce plastic by exchanging plastic bowls/cups with glass. Instead of saran plastic to cover foods, use paper and elastic bands or silicon stretchable lids. Use cast iron or stainless steel pans instead of teflon pans. Cover the house in plants!! They are your friends and plants such as Cactus plants can help reduce emf exposure. Purchase some Orgone pyramids and place around the house to balance natural electrical energy.  These are just a handful of things, there are so many more little things we can do and change around the house to make it safer and less toxic... sometimes the home needs a little detox.\n\u2014\u2014\nFollow my personal \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd @itsazeem\nFollow my other \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd @foundverity\n\u2014\u2014\n#populationcontrol #staywoke #nwo #population #newworldorder #elite #explorepage #pinealgland #wakeuppeople #truthseeker #thirdeye #wakeupsheeple #anonymous  #conscious #secretsocieties #mindcontrol #consciousawareness #politics #selfaware #freedomthinker #illuminati #truthseeker  #conscious #awareness #peoplepower #depopulation #conspiracy #wakeup",
