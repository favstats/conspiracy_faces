    "description": "\u201cOur mental and emotional \u2018vibes\u2019 of all kinds are broadcast as a series of wave patterns and these draw towards us similar wave patterns in the form of people, places, ways of life and experiences. What we give out, we attract to us.\u201d - David Icke from \u2018The Biggest Secret\u2019...\n.\n.\nAre you aware that your thoughts and emotions emit certain frequencies depending on the way you\u2019re feeling? Those frequencies attract other frequencies in the same range that \u201cresonate\u201d with one another. When you have a \u201cbad vibe\u201d about something or someone that is your energetic field picking up on frequencies (or energetic information) that do NOT resonate with your current energetic state. In other words you create your reality...\n.\n.\nIf you choose to act with love, compassion, gratitude and kindness towards others, you will automatically attract that same energy. This corresponds well with the 7 Hermetic Principles as well as the Law Of Attraction...\n.\n.\nIf you haven\u2019t read \u2018The Biggest Secret\u2019 or any of Icke\u2019s other books I highly recommend checking his material out. Definitely one of the catalysts in my own awakening... a TRUE hero to the people!\n.\n.\n#spiritualawakening #davidicke #lawofattraction #meditation #gratitude #love #compassion #7hermeticprinciples #lovingkindness #shinbuddhism #awakening #higherconsciousness #raiseyourvibration #chakras #thegreatawakening #consciousness #earthing #plantbased #consciousliving #thebiggestsecret #ufo #ufos #extraterrestrial #flyingsaucer #highstrangeness #buddhism #zazen",
