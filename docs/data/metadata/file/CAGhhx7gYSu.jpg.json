    "description": "Part of me was hesitant to share about doing lyme treatment for a few reasons:\u2063\n\u2063\n~I\u2019m doing SO much better than just even a year and a half ago. Lingering symptoms and flares ups, while challenging are bearable\n\u2063\n~I don\u2019t find identity in illness. Not that sharing means I do. I just have resolved a lot of trauma...still am \u2063\n\u2063\n~Some things I just don\u2019t feel like sharing. Healing can be very personal \u2063\n\u2063\nFor those who don\u2019t know my journey, I started having severe neurological symptoms following a tdap shot back in June 2014. I figured out I tested positive for Lyme about two years later (it was probably dormant and got activated), and I have done several treatments since then, including SVF stem cells, herbs, ozone, IVs, DNRS, and more with EOs and emotional release. I have made HUGE progress, and if I had to just settle for where I\u2019m at now, I could and with gratitude. \u2063\n\u2063\nBut I believe I\u2019m being called into other areas of my purpose and other areas of healing that I haven\u2019t made the time for. That I\u2019ve been settling when actually God has more for me. That if I am willing and ready to receive...I CAN. \u2063\nSo this week I will share. Many MANY are suffering and are completely debilitated. They cannot get help, and they don\u2019t know where to look. But I hope this spreads awareness because lyme continues to be ignored, while it\u2019s reached epidemic numbers.\n\u2063\nWatch my stories to see more of this journey and I\u2019ll save in my lymestop highlight\ud83c\udf3b Any questions about Lyme or coinfections?
