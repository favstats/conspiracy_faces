    "description": "Not every message was made for us - and everything doesn\u2019t need a response from us. It\u2019s all at our fingertips but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ours. If it doesn\u2019t sit right with you, keep going. If it\u2019s not your truth, keep searching. If you have more questions, keep digging. It seems like we\u2019re living in an era where we expect strangers on the internet to cater to us. To say what we want them to say. To be who we want them to be. To think the way we want them to think. To stop questioning, start obeying and to never go against the \u201cnorm\u201d. We seem to think that everyone\u2019s message is FOR us and that it better be exactly what we want it to be. I am not here for that \ud83d\udeab I\u2019m also not here to make you like me. I will always be me. Regardless of how that makes you feel about me. And I hope you will always be you, because I like people that aren\u2019t exactly like me \ud83d\ude09",
