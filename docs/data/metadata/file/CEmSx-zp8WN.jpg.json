    "description": "What can people do when they KNOW they are FREE.... when they collectively don\u2019t conform? Well, these days it can be something as simple as shopping for groceries, normally, no anxiety about the mask... just normal.\n\nWe\u2019ve been surrounding ourselves with people who live how they live and make no apologies. These people don\u2019t make anyone else live the way they do. Others who don\u2019t want to do what we do, in this case, are free put on their mask or free to choose a place that aligns with their way of living.\n\nYes there are mandates, the businesses risk misdemeanors and fines. But some stores are taking that risk. I want to explain, this is how it\u2019s worked for us.\n\nWe can\u2019t do this alone.... we can try. But really, three things need to happen, in my opinion for this to work well.\n\n1. Individually we stand up, we take the masks off. We tell/show businesses and schools they are supported.\n\n2. Business owners who do not wish to require masking in their stores, stop enforcing it, allow their employees as well as customers to choose mask or no mask. School boards stand up for parents and children.\n\n3. Local law enforcement has to choose not to enforce these top down mandates that aren\u2019t actually law.\n\nIndividuals, businesses, elected officials, law enforcement.\n\nI keep thinking of a line from a Toby Keith song \u201ca little less talk and a lot more action.\u201d We\u2019ve been talking a lot of talk, but are we seeking out and supporting businesses that are willing to take a risk and take a stand? Are we doing our part, are we at least trying?\n\nI know, it\u2019s easier said than done. Most things are, but if it means enough we always find a way and it starts with one person, one business standing up for what most of us want.",
