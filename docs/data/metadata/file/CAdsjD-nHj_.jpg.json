    "description": "Right! FOH with that \"\"new normal\"\" bs.. We are free. We are sovereign individual beings that reside in liberty. They can't control us. We win. They lose. We manifest everything we want in life. We stick to our own normal, our own reality before this. Not some \"\"new normal\"\" attempted control by the powerless entities known as the 1%. They're weak. They're losing control. That's why they're trying to silence people who speak the truth! They're on their last leg at trying to control and manipulate the people but they can't control us. They're microscopic compared to the people who know the truth. We can easily figuratively step on them. We have all the power. Don't you forget that. Remember we can manifest our own realities. Our beliefs dictate our realities. That's the #lawofattraction . If we believe we have all the power, then we have all the power! Also, it's pretty evident that we do. We are the 99%. We can easily destroy the evil 1%. And I'm seeing that we will. Just because they have money doesn't mean shit. Money is paper. Monopoly. You gotta get out of this systemic socially engineered way of thinking. Money is a social construct. Without people's idea of money being worth anything, it would be useless. The 1% own all the banks. Banks=cash. So without people's ideas of the 1% being important or worth anything, they would be worthless. Which they are. We don't need them. They only want to control, manipulate, and destroy the people. Bottom line: We are in power. The 1% should be afraid. The 1% are powerless and weak.",
