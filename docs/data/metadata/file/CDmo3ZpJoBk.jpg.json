I say my piece. I stand up for what I believe. Heck yes I do! But I also LOVE MY FAMILY and FIND JOY in the ONE LIFE GOD GAVE ME.\n\nThere are no do overs. I won\u2019t let a governor mandating me to live his way cause me anxiety or stress that makes me live less, smile less, enjoy less.\n\nThere\u2019s gotta be some good out there ... let\u2019s talk about it!\ud83d\udda4",
