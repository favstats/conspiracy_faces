    "description": "Bernell Trammell, a black man from Milwaukee was shot and killed in front of his own business for holding a \u201cvote for Trump\u201d sign. His murderer is still on the loose. \n\nHe did nothing wrong. Another innocent life lost. Yet, I see NO posts about his black life mattering. I see no outrage. I see no celebrities screaming for his justice. Why? Is it because he was a conservative black man? And those lives don\u2019t matter? \n\nBecause last I checked, ALL BLACK LIVES MATTER.\n\nSay his name. Say it with me. He mattered. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#lockherup #deepstate #hillaryforprison #cabal #fallcabal #frazzledrip #spiritcooking #clintonbodycount #nofilter #clintonemails #hollyweird #adrenochrome #falseflag #pizzagate #pedogate #epsteindidntkillhimself #epsteinisland #draintheswamp #wakeup #arrestbillgates #wwg1wga #savethechildren #redpill #blm #justiceforbernelltrammell",
